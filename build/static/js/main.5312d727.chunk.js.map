I got my PhD in Computer\n                                    Science from UCLA in 2000 (wow, 20 years\n                                    ago!). Before joining UT Austin, I worked at IBM T. J. Watson Research Center for\n                                    three years, from 2000 to 2003. My\n                                    research is quite interdisciplinary, from algorithms and software to chip\n                                    design/manufacturing and emerging\n                                    technologies. At UT Austin, I teach digital logic design, as well as VLSI\n                                    (very-large-scale integration) and CAD\n                                    (computer aided design) courses. I also direct the UT Design Automation (UTDA) Lab.\n                                    You may wonder what design\n                                    automation is about. When you design modern integrated circuits (or chips) and\n                                    systems, which nowadays can have billions\n                                    of transistors with feature size in the nanometer (10-9 meter) scale, you have to\n                                    rely on all kinds of sophisticated\n                                    design automation or CAD tools and software. My research’s main focus is to develop\n                                    cutting edge algorithms and software\n                                    that enable these complex design and optimization processes.</p>\n                                    <h2><strong>What is the driving force behind your work and what you pursue?</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>The “why” behind my work is very simple: to\n                                    design better chips faster with higher performance, lower power, lower cost,\n                                    etc. You might have heard about Moore’s Law, the amazing law that has been driving the\n                                    semiconductor and information\n                                    technology industries for more than 50 years. My research is related to  how to extend\n                                    and expand Moore’s Law through\n                                    intelligent design and technology co-optimizations. I have collaborated with many\n                                    industry partners, including IBM,\n                                    Intel, Nvidia, Xilinx, Cadence, Synopsys, Google, etc., and many of our research results\n                                    have been widely used in\n                                    industry to develop cutting-edge chips. To see your work having real impact is very\n                                    satisfying.</p>\n                                    <div className=\"text-center\">\n                                        <img className=\"chronicle-pics\" src={passion} alt=\"Passion led us here\" />\n                                    </div>\n                                    <br></br>\n                                    <p>I have worked in both academia and industry. Both have pros and cons, and you just have\n                                    to ask yourself where you\n                                    feel most “empowered”. Academia typically looks at longer-term and more fundamental\n                                    research problems, with no\n                                    immediate product pressure. On the other hand, since we are in electrical and computer\n                                    engineering which tie very\n                                    closely with various industries, we do need to talk frequently to those industry\n                                    colleagues to understand their\n                                    needs so that we can identify the most important problems to work on. In academia, I\n                                    generally have freedom to\n                                    pursue the topics that I’m interested in (well, if I manage to get funding and students to work on them ☺). On the\n                                    other hand, big companies like IBM, Intel, Google have much more resources, such as the most advanced technology\n                                    nodes and data centers. That’s why some professors move to industry. It’s really a personal choice. But we can also\n                                    send students to perform collaborative research. For me, the biggest accomplishment as a\n                                    professor is the students. Seeing them grow and be successful makes me happy and keeps me going!\n                                    </p>\n                                    <h2><strong>How did you end up doing what you do now?</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>I took an unconventional path to become an\n                                    electrical and computer engineering professor. My undergraduate major at\n                                    Peking University was physics, or specifically geophysics. I came to UCLA to pursue my\n                                    graduate study in Atmospheric\n                                    Sciences in 1993, and my first research at UCLA was on some millennium-scale climate\n                                    change problem. After two years of\n                                    study and research, I developed some theoretical and numerical models, but then the\n                                    problem arrived: how can I verify\n                                    the correctness of my model in my lifetime? Incidentally I took some Computer Science\n                                    classes at that time, and found my\n                                    new passion in VLSI and CAD. I like solving hard problems, and VLSI CAD seems to have\n                                    lots of very intriguing and\n                                    “mission impossible” problems. And more importantly, you will know how good your\n                                    solutions are very quickly, within\n                                    hours or days! Of course, I had to make up a lot of knowledge and courses in EE [Electrical Engineering] and CS. On the\n                                    other hand, my physics training gave me good intuition in formulating and solving those problems. My UCLA PhD ended\n                                    nicely with an Outstanding PhD Award, and I then joined IBM T. J.

I am Ray Chang and I am a second-year\n                                    bioengineering PhD student at Stanford. I am in Professor Manu Prakash’s lab, and I\n                                    am working on the fluid mechanics problem of an interesting freshwater ciliate\n                                    called <i>Spirostomum ambiguum</i> using both theoretical and experimental approaches.\n                                    To be more specific, <i>Spirostomum</i> is a giant single cell organism (it can grow\n                                    up to 4 mm in length!) with an exceptional ability to perform ultrafast contractions;\n                                    the maximum acceleration in the contraction process can be up to 15G! A normal human\n                                    cannot tolerate such high acceleration, but this organism uses the hydrodynamic pulse wave\n                                    generated by the contraction as a communication tool and must be able to perform such a\n                                    task repetitively without damaging itself. I am looking at the intracellular\n                                    organization of this organism to see how the internal structure helps dissipate the\n                                    energy generated in this process. </p>\n                                    <p className=\"text-center\">\n                                        <iframe title=\"spirosto\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/aPy_8x182UA\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\"\n                                            allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n                                    </p>\n                                    <p>Aside from this project, I also play an assistant role in other frugal science projects\n                                    related to the medical field in our lab because of my background in medicine. For\n                                    example, our lab is working on converting a commercially-available snorkel mask into\n                                    personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare workers, or into an interface for\n                                    noninvasive ventilation. I have worked on designing PPE donning, doffing and\n                                    disinfection protocol, and some physiological testing. This dual role is very common\n                                    in our lab: most of us work as the primary lead of our own project but also have a\n                                    supportive role for other members’ projects.</p>\n                                    <p className=\"text-center\"><iframe title=\"ambiguum\"\n                                        src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/--9LSS4dvmA\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\"\n                                        allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n                                    </p>\n                                    <p>In the long run, I am interested in pursuing an academic career, with a potential focus\n                                    on cellular biophysics. There are many interesting problems in the unseen microscopic\n                                    world. For example, how does a single cell sustain its needs when it grows to a large\n                                    size? How does the cell transmit signals across the cell without an action\n                                    potential? Is it a common strategy for cells to modify its internal structure for energy\n                                    dissipation purposes? These are all fundamental questions which require careful experimental\n                                    design from a strong theoretical point of view, which is why I find them so fascinating!\n                                    </p>\n                                    <h2><strong>Why do you do what you do now?</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>This is an interesting question. I think the most important reason why I am a researcher is because it is fun. It is fun to ask these seemingly random questions which actually carry serious fundamental meanings. It is fun to see what life (other than model organisms) looks like and how they evolve really fascinating strategies to tackle the problems unique to their scale. If you want to learn more about how fun such a world could be, I encourage you to explore a therapeutic YouTube channel called “Journey to the Microcosmos”. While I wanted to study biophysics in graduate school, I couldn’t apply for a PhD in a biophysics program because of funding issues surrounding my foreigner status. Instead, I was able to apply for a bioengineering program because it provides a more quantitative point of view compared to other branches in bioscience. However, I think bioengineering is a good fit for me as its fundamental research matches my interests while its application matches my abilities.</p>\n                                    <p>One reason why I am currently aiming for an academic career is because I enjoy teaching. I hope that a more quantitative mindset can someday become the second “central dogma” in biology: living organisms have to obey the laws of physics, and these laws set a predictable constraint on what they can do and how they can perform a specific task. In my 4th year of medical school I started a blog called “Three Minute Biophysics” to educate myself and others about both classic and modern research in biophysics. I like to share with other people joyful and insightful moments when physics and biology marry together, and I think those tiny moments are what motivate me to explore all the unanswered questions we have about biology.</p>\n                                    <p>The other reason why I am considering an academic job is because I appreciate the freedom of academia. I want to work on something that I genuinely find interesting, even if its application may not be evident at first glance. I believe that only through studying these peculiar microorganisms can we truly understand the limits of life and what a living creature is capable of. Staying in academia after graduation will allow me to continue studying unique microorganisms that are seemingly unimportant but could provide novel solutions to the problems we have today.\n                                    </p>\n                                    <h2><strong>How did you end up doing what you do now?</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>I entered medical school after high school because I was not sure about what I wanted to do. Even though I had been thinking about doing research back then, I didn’t feel passionate enough about pure biology research to major in biology. I was also interested in physics but was not very confident in my abilities to major in physics. During my freshman year, I got really interested in psychology. I spent all my free time voraciously reading all kinds of psychology books and I thought I would one day become a psychiatrist.</p>\n                                    <p>However, in my sophomore year, I felt that I had learned enough psychology to interpret and handle my own personality and interpersonal relationship problems, and psychology became less interesting to me. I decided to take a psychology and a physics elective at the same time to see which one I enjoyed more. The physics class I took was “Introduction to Biophysics” taught by Dr. Po-Ling Kuo, and it completely changed my life. I was so inspired by how physics can be used to predict a diverse range of biological problems, and I really enjoyed the textbook, “Physical Biology of the Cell” written by Rob Phillips. After chatting with Dr. Kuo during an office hour about my interests in pursuing biophysics, he invited me to join his lab and I worked with him part time for 4 years.</p>\n                                    <p>After joining Dr. Kuo’s lab, I prepared myself for a career in biophysics. I knew that my physics and math abilities were not going to be as good as a physics major student, so I devoted all my free time to self-studying physics and math. I was very lucky to have a friend who was also interested in physics and would study with me, and I miss the times when he would message me with a question and ask me to solve it. As medical school classes were quite heavy, I had to stay in the library for the entire day and even on weekends. Even though that may sound miserable, I appreciated that time when I could enjoy the pure joy of knowledge.</p>\n                                    <div className=\"text-center\">\n                                        <img className=\"chronicle-pics\" src={lightbulb} alt=\"Light bulb\" />\n                                    </div>\n                                    <br></br>\n                                    <p>7 years of medical school was still a long journey and I had questioned my decisions from time to time. Over the 7 years, I thought about becoming a psychiatrist, nephrologist, pathologist, cardiologist and neurologist at different stages of my training while still doubting my abilities to study physics. However, I am glad that constant exposure to the inspiration of research helped me overcome my doubt and pointed me in the direction I should go. When I would write a new post for my blog introducing others’ great work, I wished that I could become part of that community. I wished I could try to explore my own limits, and to one day introduce my own work on my blog! With that in mind, I decided to apply for graduate school during my final (internship) year in medical school.</p>\n                                    <p>In my intern year, I had more responsibilities taking care of patients and needed to regularly stay on duty, which gave me a chance to imagine what my life would be like if I decided to stay in hospital work. I felt the need to constantly engage in difficult conversations around patient status and the uncertainty around staying on duty was draining to me. Even though I performed very well during my internship and received positive feedback from my senior colleagues, I felt that I was giving the patients suboptimal care because I was not the best possible “me”. In addition, I realized that the emotional burden of working at a hospital prevented me from maintaining my biophysics studying hobby, which forced me to make a decision between the two. Luckily, I got into Stanford with God’s help and my past investment in applying for graduate school, and I really appreciate the chance.</p>\n                                    <h1 className=\"text-center\">&middot; &middot; &middot;</h1>\n                                    <h2 className=\"text-center\"><strong>Tips for College Students</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>As a college student, the advice I would give is to explore your interests\n                                    and start preparing yourself early. I would not have been admitted to graduate\n                                    school if I only started preparing for it in my 5th or 6th year of medical\n                                    school. Having a clear direction is more important than blindly wasting your\n                                    efforts. Spend your time exploring your passions when the cost of failure is\n                                    still low, really dive into the one that you love, and plan early for your\n                                    long-term goals. I hope everyone can eventually work on something they are\n                                    passionate about!</p>\n                                    <p>Another thing that I found very helpful is to embrace a growth mindset.\n                                    Intelligence can be built and we should believe in our abilities to learn.\n                                    There is a stereotype that students in biology or medicine are bad at math and\n                                    physics, and I think that is very toxic and detrimental.

Every student is encouraged to do whatever\n                                    they want, and there is a strong atmosphere in the school that if you want to do\n                                    something, you should aim for the best. Therefore, our high school is famous in\n                                    almost every aspect: from international science Olympiad, science fair, pop\n                                    dance club, rugby team, to color guard team, because everyone is aiming for\n                                    the best. I also remember when I had naturalist hobbies such as plant\n                                    identification, and I bought many plant atlases just to study how to\n                                    differentiate them. I encourage everyone to be serious about the things you\n                                    like, and really invest time to do research on it and to practice [what you\n                                    learned].</p>\n                                    <div className=\"text-center\">\n                                        <img className=\"chronicle-pics\" src={laptopanddesk} alt=\"Laptop and Desk\" />\n                                    </div>\n                                    <br></br>\n                                    <h2 className=\"text-center\"><strong>Tips for People Interested in Medical School</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>I also have advice for people who are interested in medical school. There are many\n                                    aspects of medicine that are very different from what ordinary people imagine a\n                                    medical career to be. Uncovering the mysteries of the human brain or finding cures for\n                                    cancer are not going to be a major part of your training, and your hospital volunteering\n                                    experiences will be very different from a usual day as a healthcare worker. A huge\n                                    aspect of medicine is having to communicate terrible news to an already shattered\n                                    family. As you get more and more accustomed to the practical know-how of taking care\n                                    of a patient, it is possible to become emotionally worn out by seemingly trivial details\n                                    that actually become huge roadblocks to treatment flow, such as health insurance status,\n                                    bed availability of post-acute care facilities, or missing family members who hold the\n                                    power to make decisions for a patient. Think carefully before you apply to medical\n                                    school, and remember to take care of yourself if you are admitted.</p>\n                                </Col>\n                                <Col md=\"2\"></Col>\n                            </Row>\n                        </Container>\n                        <Container className=\"main-page text-center\">\n                            <Button href=\"/chronicles\" variant=\"info\">All Chronicles</Button>\n                        </Container>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <Footer />\n            </div>\n        );\n    }\n}\n\nexport default ConstExposure;","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/williamhsu.8b209f18.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/groupofpeople.8486c4ed.png\";","import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport '../App.css';\nimport AppNavbar from '../components/AppNavbar';\nimport Footer from '../components/Footer';\nimport { Container, Row, Col } from 'reactstrap';\n// import ChroniclesHeader from '../components/ChroniclesHeader';\nimport williamhsu from '../resources/images/chronicles/williamhsu.png';\nimport groupofpeople from '../resources/images/chronicles/groupofpeople.png';\nimport timer from '../resources/images/chronicles/timer.png';\nimport { Button } from 'react-bootstrap';\n\nclass GoodTech extends Component {\n    render() {\n        return (\n            <div className=\"all-content\">\n                <div className=\"content-wrap\">\n                    <AppNavbar />\n                    {/* <div className=\"blue-container\">\n                        <ChroniclesHeader />\n                    </div> */}\n                    <div className=\"main-page\">\n                        <Container className=\"text-center\">\n                            <h1>Good Technology is for Helping People</h1>\n                            <h6 className=\"authors\">BY YUCONG YANG &middot; RACHEL CHEN &middot; RAY CHANG &middot; HARRY SIO</h6>\n                            <h6 className=\"date\">Dec 25, 2020 &middot; 10 min read</h6>\n                        </Container>\n                        <Container className=\"text-center\">\n                            <img className=\"chronicle-pics\" src={williamhsu} alt=\"William's headshot\" />\n                        </Container>\n                        <Container>\n                            <Row>\n                                <Col md=\"2\"></Col>\n                                <Col md=\"8\">\n                                    <br></br>\n                                    <p>\n                                        Dr. William Hsu is the director of application engineering at Voltraware\n                                        Semiconductor Co. with expertise in inductive/wireless power transfer systems and projects that span the field of\n                                        consumer electronics, industrial instrument, and customization required applications. Dr. Hsu has a Ph.D. in\n                                        electrical and electronics engineering at the University of Auckland with years of experience in R&D team managing and\n                                        practical wireless power circuit/system design.

We establish design housing that\n                                        specializes in wireless power-related IC (integrated circuit) design. The application for IC is based on magnetic\n                                        resonance (MR) technology. This technology is different from the magnetic induction wireless charging that we see in our\n                                        smartphones and smartwatches. The main difference between these two is that the MR system that we are now developing\n                                        offers wireless charging that can produce and maintain power delivery to multiple devices with different power\n                                        requirements. Most importantly, MR systems have a longer charging distance. These features provide a user experience\n                                        that is closer to the expectations that people have for true wireless charging. Internally, my job involves advising the\n                                        development of wireless power, protocol planning, specification development, architectural level design, and functional\n                                        verification and application testing for IC. I also do a lot of external work such as technology and product promotion,\n                                        research on the needs of potential clients and markets, and networking with our strategic partners. I need to not only\n                                        understand the technology, but also how this technology is useful for our potential clients. There's a saying that “good\n                                        technology is only helpful when you really are helping people''. My role is trying to get our technology out into the\n                                        market and to receive critical feedback from everyone we have been in contact with.\n                                    </p>\n                                    <h2><strong>How do you deal with negative responses from the market to your product?</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>\n                                        I think critical feedback is a good thing. The reason customers are not giving you positive feedback is because they are\n                                        not getting what they expect out of your product. The good thing for us is that we can consider people’s needs and\n                                        expectations when thinking about whether we have missed anything that we should be considering to perfect our product.\n                                    </p>\n                                    <h2><strong>What is the driving force behind your work and what you’re pursuing?</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>\n                                        In my final year of university, I worked on a project to develop a wireless charging race car. This project was really\n                                        interesting as every student had to contribute to the project to create the best design that would produce a really fast\n                                        and stable car. I didn't know that power transfer could be done wirelessly because it was something I had never seen\n                                        before in my life. It got me thinking about wireless charging as the future of conventional power delivery, which could\n                                        be something worth looking into. When I graduated from university, I found out that our university was really focused on\n                                        wireless power research and it was one of the few pioneers in the world working in this field. One of the most important\n                                        things in choosing a post-graduate institution is to find a school that is focused on a certain field that you are\n                                        really interested in because you can get more resources, mentors, and experience. In addition, if your lab is focused on\n                                        a specific research area, they can get more laboratory instruments that are definitely helpful for your research. After\n                                        I found out that I was interested in wireless power research, I began to dig into the field and discovered that there\n                                        are quite a few things about this area that keep me passionate about this work. I know that this technology brings many\n                                        conveniences to people's daily life and it's going to change how people behave now, so my work will definitely have some\n                                        impact on the future. 15 years ago, wireless power technology was not being explored enough. In 2007, the first\n                                        demonstrations of power transferring systems to transfer power from two meters away didn't get much attention because\n                                        the demand and practical implications were not really there. But now for almost everything that you see, like cars,\n                                        motorcycles, and bikes, everyone is talking about wireless charging because they realized how convenient this technology\n                                        is. I think the reason why I wanted to pursue wireless power technology is because I know that it's going to have a huge\n                                        impact on our daily life. I also see a lot of potential in this technology in its different applications, for example,\n                                        as a necessary method for charging medical implants.\n                                    </p>\n                                    <div className=\"text-center\">\n                                        <img className=\"chronicle-pics\" src={timer} alt=\"timer\" />\n                                    </div>\n                                    <br></br>\n                                    <h2><strong>Can you talk about your educational path and the process you took to get to where you are today?</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>\n                                        When I was in Taiwan for junior high school, I remember I was really bad at memorizing historical dates, names of\n                                        historical figures, and geographical locations. At the time, I thought that I wasn’t as smart as the other kids in my\n                                        class. I later found out that the subjects I was bad at were not difficult, but rather I didn't find them interesting. I\n                                        didn't bother to remember all the dates and names. After I moved to New Zealand at 13 years old, I discovered that I was\n                                        really interested in biology, math, and physics and found that I could be really good at them. When you are in school, I\n                                        think it is beneficial to focus on the things that you are interested in because you are more likely to pay attention\n                                        and dig deeper into those courses, which can help you in discovering your interests.\n                                    </p>\n                                    <p>\n                                        After graduating from high school, I got into electrical engineering because that was the only major that I was\n                                        interested in. Because I only focused on the things I’m good at and interested in, it was easy for me to choose one path\n                                        and to eliminate all the other options. I focused on wireless power systems because I realized that finding practical\n                                        applications for wireless power was a critical problem for this technology. If we want to make a cost-effective solution\n                                        that can be easily adopted by consumers, we have to come up with wireless power applications and ways to implement them.\n                                        Normally, a solution to an engineering problem depends on how you look at the problem, so there can be several solutions\n                                        depending on the situation or environment that you are dealing with. You can then choose one of the proposed solutions\n                                        that is the best fit for that kind of environment.\n                                    </p>\n                                    <p>\n                                        After I graduated from college, I started to think about how there were not many people who are working with wireless\n                                        charging, despite it being an interesting and critical field in the market. I decided to move back to Taiwan and started\n                                        a business with a partner to focus our work solely on the solution for the lack of applications for wireless power.\n                                        Because I was in charge, I realized that there are not many people who are focused on wireless power technology in\n                                        Taiwan, which made it very difficult to recruit people with a lot of background knowledge on wireless power. However,\n                                        difficult problems can be an opportunity to explore different possibilities and ways of doing things. I needed to share\n                                        my knowledge on wireless power with all my colleagues to bring everyone up to the same level so we could all think about\n                                        how to work together to solve the problems we faced. You can't be fighting and figuring out a problem by yourself.\n                                        Working in a team with people who have different specialties allows room to provide different opinions and perspectives\n                                        on the same problem, which can actually solve the problem in a more comprehensive, faster, and creative way.\n                                    </p>\n                                    <h1 className=\"text-center\">&middot; &middot; &middot;</h1>\n                                    <h2><strong>When you said that there are not many people working on wireless charging, how did you recognize that as an opportunity?\n                                    How do you deal with the uncertainties and challenges of an underdeveloped field?</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>\n                                        Usually when people are approaching an underdeveloped field, the first thing that comes to mind is the issue of\n                                        finances. However, I didn't think too much about the financial side of starting a company. I was more focused on\n                                        technology development. I do believe that there are a lot of risks that we have to take into consideration, especially\n                                        when there are not many people working in the same field. Sometimes I feel like the whole market looks like a jungle,\n                                        and I don't know what I will get if I walk into it. To be frank, for the first six to seven years, we barely made a\n                                        profit from the technology that we developed. We were too focused on technology promotion and trying to come up with a\n                                        design that fit our imagination of the clients' needs, which is definitely not a realistic approach. If you don't\n                                        interact with your client enough, get to know the market well, or understand the clients’ demands, the only thing that\n                                        you're going to develop is a product that only fits your expectations and imaginations, but not your clients’. That was\n                                        a big failure for us. We had developed something that looked pretty nice, and we thought that was a perfect solution for\n                                        certain applications. We produced a “perfect” product for our clients, but they didn't give us positive feedback on it.\n                                        Afterwards, we realized that we needed to rethink and redo the design processes to address their requirements.\n                                    </p>\n                                    <p>\n                                        One of the risks of working in a field where there are not many people working in the same field is that no one can tell\n                                        you if you are doing the wrong thing. But on the other hand, if you are doing something that other people are also\n                                        doing, you are going to look at a market that will be saturated by people in a few years, or even in a few months\n                                        because they are doing something that already has a demand and is something people already know. If you put your head\n                                        into something that people don't really know, it's just at that moment in time, they didn't know that they needed it.\n                                        But if you can see the need for your product, you can see its potential. If you can see what the technology can actually\n                                        bring to people, you should be confident enough to actually put your hands into that area. When Apple announced its\n                                        first smartphone, people were confused about what they are going to do with this phone. It didn’t even have buttons, and\n                                        they had no idea how to use it. When people realized that the smartphone brought the cell phone user experience to the\n                                        next level, people started to follow in Apple’s steps.\n                                    </p>\n                                    <h2><strong>What do you think wireless power is moving towards in\n                                    the future? Is wireless power currently in a primitive stage, just\n                                    like smartphones were when Apple first introduced them?</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>\n                                        Yes. I believe that the wireless power that\n                                        we see now in smartphones or smartwatches is not at its final stage. The\n                                        reason why I say this is because the wireless charging we see now in the smartphone is just a fundamental,\n                                        cost-effective solution that can bring wireless power into our daily life, but it is not the perfect solution. If you\n                                        ask anyone who is working on wireless power, you would probably get a very similar answer. The reason why we are\n                                        adopting wireless power is because we want a fairly good charging distance and good spatial freedom, which is our\n                                        ultimate expectation for wireless charging. So far, I don’t believe there is anything like this on the market. The\n                                        solution we see on the market nowadays is just something that companies are trying to get a profit out of, and\n                                        unfortunately it has become an industry standard. They developed a product and released it even though they knew that\n                                        the product is not perfect. We should dedicate time to bringing this technology into the best shape it can be. It should\n                                        have features like further transferring distance, high efficiency, simultaneous one-to-multiple charging, and most\n                                        importantly, spatial freedom, which means that as long as you put your receiver on the charging pad you should be able\n                                        to continuously charge without any interference.\n                                    </p>\n                                    <h1 className=\"text-center\">&middot; &middot; &middot;</h1>\n                                    <h2 className=\"text-center\"><strong>Tips for College Students</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>\n                                        I remember when I was in\n                                        university or high school, many courses weren't\n                                        mandatory. Some friends of mine decided to choose easier courses because\n                                        they wanted to get good grades on their\n                                        reports. I also remember that some other friends and I decided to take the\n                                        courses that we thought were more useful.\n                                        Those courses may involve many engineering mathematics, or a high workload\n                                        every week. I think it was worth it because I\n                                        still use a lot of the engineering mathematics and skills that I had\n                                        accumulated back then in my work today. I think my\n                                        advice is don't take the shortcut, or stated in a positive way, use your\n                                        time wisely on the things that you think are\n                                        worth investing in. If you know that you're going to an administrative job,\n                                        of course you need to know how to use Excel,\n                                        spreadsheets, or something like that. But if you know that you are going to\n                                        be a power-system engineer, then you need to\n                                        be familiar with simulation tools. If you are going to be an electronic\n                                        design engineer, you need to know how the\n                                        operational amplifier works. If you know that you are going in a certain\n                                        direction, then you have to reflect on the\n                                        skill sets that you need to have to make your life easier in the future. I\n                                        remember that when I knew that I was going to\n                                        focus on electronics design, I took several courses that were directly\n                                        related to that, and I still use a lot of skills\n                                        and the knowledge I learned from that time period.</p>\n                                    <p>I think interacting more with people is another important thing. Most of my\n                                    peers back in the day were just trying to\n                                    pass their courses, so they spent a lot of time purely on studying. However,\n                                    I’ve realized that once you start working,\n                                    you come to know that you can only achieve so much by yourself, and those\n                                    achievements cannot be greater than a group of\n                                    people who share the same vision. If you can cultivate really good\n                                    relationship and communication skills, a lot of\n                                    problems can be communicated to and easily solved by a group of people, not\n                                    just by yourself. I think interactions with\n                                    people are another important aspect that we need to cultivate when we are\n                                        still in school.</p>\n                                    <p>\n                                        Another important piece of advice is to focus on the things that you are\n                                        going to do. Focus on the courses that you\n                                        believe are going to help you in the future. We need to have a core belief,\n                                        a passion, or a certain path that we want to\n                                        take. After we have decided this path, then we have to take a step back and\n                                        think about what would allow us to achieve\n                                        or go to that path. We need to set up goals for ourselves, and then we need\n                                        to set a direction. For example, once you\n                                        realize you want to be an electrical engineer, you need to know what you\n                                        need to do to get yourself prepared to go onto\n                                        that path. If you know that you need to get into the electrical engineering\n                                        major, you need to figure out what you need\n                                        to do in high school or college to prepare for that major. I think that is a\n                                        logical way of pursuing things.\n                                        </p>\n                                    <br></br>\n                                    <h2 className=\"text-center\"><strong>Tips for High School Students</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>I believe some people already have a vision, so they know how to pursue something that they\n                                    want. For the group of people who are still unsure about what they're going to do, I think the best way is to listen to\n                                    other people, and ask yourself questions. A good starting point is to explore as many things as possible. For example,\n                                    math, physics, chemistry, or anything. Nowadays you can get a lot of information from the internet. You can also talk to\n                                    your friends in school or actually go to a few classes on different topics to see how you like them, so you will have\n                                    more of an idea of what's your interests and passions. Talk to people. Talk to your friends, seniors, or even people who\n                                    are already working. How did they figure out what they wanted? All those interactions can give you a lot of ideas about\n                                    how you can choose your path, how you can choose your major, or choose the\n                                    things that you want to do. I understand that\n                                    a lot of people have trouble knowing what they want to do, but after you\n                                    talk to a lot of people, you will start to\n                                    realize that it is not difficult to choose. The reason why people are having\n                                    trouble choosing is because they don’t have\n                                    enough information. Once you have enough information, you will know what you\n                                    are good at and what you are passionate about.</p>\n                                    <div className=\"text-center\">\n                                        <img className=\"chronicle-pics\" src={groupofpeople} alt=\"Group of people sitting in a circle\" />\n                                    </div>\n                                    <br></br>\n                                    <h2 className=\"text-center\"><strong>Tips for People Interested in STEM Career Path</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>I think my advice is more of a general one. For people who are pursuing a STEM career path, we need to realize that we\n                                    need to have a fundamental understanding of various concepts, rather than just memorizing them. You need to know that,\n                                    when I use this equation, when I talk about this concept, when I am trying to develop this product, I know exactly what\n                                    I am doing. You cannot just follow people’s footsteps, or try to mimic something that you don't really know that well. I\n                                    say this because when I came back to Taiwan, I realized that a lot of research and development work is done by copying\n                                    reference designs that are provided by other companies, so engineers tend to use other people’s design, and maybe modify\n                                    them into a product. That is not research and development, but rather production engineering. I think something that we\n                                    need to think about is that we chose this career path because we like to understand the fundamental concepts of each\n                                    idea, even if it is just an equation or a formula. When we are taking a test, we should quote an equation because we\n                                    understand it, not just because we memorized it. If you can really do that, you can have that equation to go with you\n                                    for the entire life, rather than continuously memorizing and forgetting it. It will really help if we really understand\n                                    these concepts instead of memorizing them.</p>\n                                    <p>I remember once I was talking to a client who gave me some negative feedback. While the colleague who went with me did\n                                    not ask too many questions about what was wrong with the product, I felt the urge to understand why he was unsatisfied\n                                    with our product. I asked a lot of questions like, “why do you have this kind of feeling? Why does this not meet your\n                                    demand? What's the main reason you can't sell this to your customers? What do you think about the application value of\n                                    this product to other products? What do you think is a reasonable price for this product?”. The questions we ask\n                                    determine what kind of person we are. If you are not a person who wants to know the details you will only ask\n                                    superficial questions, but if you want to get to the bottom of everything that you have your hands on, you will ask\n                                    critical questions to get the information that you want. I believe that also echoes what I said before, that we need to\n                                    get to the fundamental stuff, because everything we do shows what kind of person we are. Especially for someone who is\n                                    pursuing a STEM career path, that is a quality that we need to succeed.</p>\n                                </Col>\n                                <Col md=\"2\"></Col>\n                            </Row>\n                        </Container>\n                        <Container className=\"main-page text-center\">\n                            <Button href=\"/chronicles\" variant=\"info\">All Chronicles</Button>\n                        </Container>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <Footer />\n            </div>\n        );\n    }\n}\n\nexport default GoodTech;","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/KZan2.51a6e39c.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/hike.d49a66ce.png\";","import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport '../App.css';\nimport AppNavbar from '../components/AppNavbar';\nimport Footer from '../components/Footer';\nimport { Container, Row, Col } from 'reactstrap';\n// import ChroniclesHeader from '../components/ChroniclesHeader';\nimport kunzan from '../resources/images/chronicles/KZan2.jpg';\nimport steps from '../resources/images/chronicles/steps.png';\nimport hike from '../resources/images/chronicles/hike.png';\nimport { Button } from 'react-bootstrap';\n\nclass ExploreRealWorld extends Component {\n    render() {\n        return (\n            <div className=\"all-content\">\n                <div className=\"content-wrap\">\n                    <AppNavbar />\n                    {/* <div className=\"blue-container\">\n                        <ChroniclesHeader />\n                    </div> */}\n                    <div className=\"main-page\">\n                        <Container className=\"text-center\">\n                            <h1>Explore the Real World</h1>\n                            <h6 className=\"authors\">BY YUCONG YANG &middot; RACHEL CHEN &middot; RAY CHANG &middot; HARRY SIO</h6>\n                            <h6 className=\"date\">Jan 15, 2021 &middot; 5 min read</h6>\n                        </Container>\n                        <Container className=\"text-center\">\n                            <img className=\"chronicle-pics\" src={kunzan} alt=\"Kun's headshot\" />\n                        </Container>\n                        <Container>\n                            <Row>\n                                <Col md=\"2\"></Col>\n                                <Col md=\"8\">\n                                    <br></br>\n                                    <p>Dr. Kun Zan is the Senior Manager of data science at Expedia Group and leads the\n                                    Marketplace Optimization Team to\n                                    research, develop, and deploy pricing and monetization products and other\n                                    algorithmic decision-making tools for the\n                                    travel platform.

I studied\n                                        mechanical engineering in college, but I was not sure what was next after\n                                        graduation. Fortunately, I happened to attend several talks in my junior year given by world-class scholars and leading\n                                        industry practitioners, which enlightened me to study the manufacturing system, which was a subfield of Industrial\n                                        Engineering. That eventually inspired me to pursue my PhD degree in Operations Research, which is one of the core\n                                        theoretical pillars of Industrial Engineering. My research was about how to make optimal decisions when facing\n                                        uncertainties, where I got intensive training in statistics, probability, and optimization, which are the fundamentals\n                                        of today’s AI and data science.\n                                    </p>\n                                    <h2><strong>What motivates you to do what you are doing now?</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>\n                                        I love the combination of travel and technology.

My daily work involves\n                                        coding, machine learning, research, product design, and end-to-end solutions,\n                                        including working with OPs, PMs, and\n                                        engineers. I have worked in different companies like Google and Facebook and am\n                                        interested in building machine-learning\n                                        models and applying them to a scalable system that can solve real production\n                                        problems. </p>\n                                    <p>\n                                        You can think of the end-to-end and back-end systems as the whole processing\n                                        workflow. Production data, like user or ad\n                                        data, includes data processing, feature extraction, and running machine learning\n                                        models to make predictions. After you\n                                        have the final decision, you show the final results to the users. The data was\n                                        processed from the beginning into a\n                                        system that leads to real impacts on the users. OPs have different roles, like\n                                        engineers doing the coding and design.\n                                        Program managers are called PMs and they work with engineers and the legal team to\n                                        make sure the project will meet\n                                        business requirements. They try to coordinate on gathering resources allocated\n                                        between engineers. For example, we have a\n                                        team of end reviewers. If a machine learning model predicts that an ad is violating\n                                        some policies, the machine learning\n                                        model can alert human reviewers to check whether the ad is selling a counterfeit\n                                        product, or scamming. Using this\n                                        information, you can decide whether this content can be posted on Facebook or not.\n                                        If we're not sure, we can have third\n                                        parties or invite reviewers to perform a final check and decide whether this ad\n                                        should be presented or rejected.\n                                    </p>\n                                    <h2><strong> What part of this process are you responsible for?</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>\n                                        I oversee the machine-learning process and\n                                        make sure the end-to-end works well. The key point I want to bring up is that\n                                        working in the industry is quite different than doing projects in school. When you\n                                        do research in school, you just focus\n                                        on one area, find a solution, publish a paper, and get some numbers. In the industry\n                                        it is better for you to have\n                                        broader knowledge of the product, the business, and the engineering. The research\n                                        and experience you get from university\n                                        is only a part of it. The other part is how you put everything together and how your\n                                        work impacts the company's\n                                        business. The best thing is when you can find something you are really interested in\n                                        that also matches the company's\n                                        goals.\n                                    </p>\n                                    <h2><strong>What drove you to choose a STEM career path in math and\n                                        computer science (CS), and what motivates you to pursue\n                                        artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning?</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>\n                                        When I studied math as an undergraduate, my\n                                        major also dealt with computational mathematics, numerical analysis and\n                                        computer science. I decided to pursue computer science in graduate school and I got\n                                        my PhD degree here in the US. At the\n                                        time I just applied to companies and would join whatever company made me an offer. I\n                                        got two offers, one on the West\n                                        Coast and the other on the East Coast. I had already been studying in California for\n                                        four years, so I decided to join\n                                        Yahoo in the Bay Area for my first job.\n                                    </p>\n                                    <p>\n                                        The first job is really important. If you can find the first job offer, that\n                                        completes the transition from newly\n                                        graduated to working in the industry. You will learn a lot from it. For my career, I\n                                        found that I’ve always been working\n                                        in the area of fraud detection, anti-spam, and integrity. It’s not really related to\n                                        what I learned or studied during my\n                                        degree at UC Riverside, but for some reason I just continued working in this area\n                                        and was still interested in it. For\n                                        the long term of your career, you want to find something you have a passion for,\n                                        which may not be related to your\n                                        master’s or bachelor’s degree’s study.\n                                    </p>\n                                    <div className=\"text-center\">\n                                        <img className=\"chronicle-pics\" src={mentor} alt=\"mentor\" />\n                                    </div>\n                                    <br></br>\n                                    <h2><strong>How did you respond when you found out that a lot of what you are doing in your career\n                                        is different from what you had learned in school?</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>\n                                        There is always new technology coming out,\n                                        especially in the software engineering and computer science areas. No matter\n                                        what you are learning at school, you will have to learn about new things being\n                                        developed in the industry. For graduate\n                                        or Master’s students, it's important that you have a major, but the most important\n                                        thing is that you gain the ability to\n                                        learn. That learning ability is really important and will help you in the industry.\n                                        I studied at UCR for four years to\n                                        get my PhD, and I feel like the process was really helpful. You have to deal with\n                                        struggle. You have to publish your\n                                        paper, you have to make sure it is accepted, you have to improve it. At least for\n                                        computer science, most people’s work\n                                        in the industry will not exactly match what they did in school. But how you deal\n                                        with these difficulties in school will\n                                        really help you in your career.\n                                    </p>\n                                    <h2><strong>Do you think it’s better for a CS major to go into a PhD\n                                        program or to get an early entrance into the industry?</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>\n                                        It depends on the individual. If you want to\n                                        gain deeper knowledge in your field, you can apply to a graduate school and\n                                        finish a PhD degree. If you only want to work in the industry, then a Bachelor’s or\n                                        Master’s degree in computer science\n                                        is enough. On the other hand, if you want to join a research department in big\n                                        companies like Google or Facebook doing\n                                        cutting-edge research, then you need a PhD from top universities. A PhD degree is\n                                        not a requirement, but it’s also not a\n                                        waste of time. You may spend three or four more years doing it, but you're learning\n                                        in the process and it will help your\n                                        career in the long term.\n                                    </p>\n                                    <h1 className=\"text-center\">&middot; &middot; &middot;</h1>\n                                    <h2><strong>I think a lot of people are facing this situation where\n                                        we're looking for our first work experience but then other jobs\n                                        are asking for prior experience.

Most people can start to prepare for applying\n                                        to these internships when they’re in their second, third, or fourth year. If you are\n                                        doing an internship at Facebook and\n                                        you’re doing really well, they can decide to hire you directly after the six-month\n                                        internship. For Google, after an\n                                        internship, you can do a very quick on-site interview. Because you already have a\n                                        mentor and a recommendation letter,\n                                        you will have a higher chance of converting into a full time job. An internship is\n                                        an opportunity, so just apply to it.\n                                        On the other hand, I was also rejected by many companies. I got my first job from\n                                        Yahoo, but I was rejected by many\n                                        companies too, so it happens to everybody. Just don't give up. Just keep trying and\n                                        keep improving. Have a positive\n                                        attitude towards the interview. Don't take the rejection personally. Just try to\n                                        improve yourself every time, and pick\n                                        out which part you can improve: communication, coding, preparation, storytelling,\n                                        etc. Improve yourself from each\n                                        failure, then as time goes on, you will get the first job. Just stay calm. Don't\n                                        give up. I know the first job is always\n                                        hard, but if you just continue to do it and try, you will get it.\n                                    </p>\n                                    <h2><strong>What did you learn in your first internship that solidified later career paths?</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>\n                                        Actually, I didn't really do an internship in a big company; my internship was from my PhD advisor.

Even\n                                        though I know some machine learning, my daily job is not really involved in\n                                        that. I'm still doing some risk modeling with AI, but I'm not doing the rewrites or\n                                        the cutting-edge model training. But\n                                        I will say, one trend of AI is moving towards more powerful computing. You can see\n                                        that now with DeepMind, TensorFlow,\n                                        and PyTorch. High computing power will give you much better results than what we\n                                        currently have, and will open the door\n                                        for new opportunities that include cloud computing, like Amazon's cloud computing.\n                                        Another trend is more on the\n                                        technical side; there are new models coming out to combine different data sets to\n                                        train the model. The other trend is\n                                        related to mobile computing.You know cell phones can do everything, but it still is\n                                        not enough because of the bandwidth\n                                        limitation in 4G. Now because of 5G and 6G techniques, your cell phone can be much\n                                        more powerful which opens up many\n                                        opportunities for different applications.\n                                    </p>\n                                    <p>\n                                        I think AI makes people work more efficiently. For example, Amazon uses AI for\n                                        product distribution. We already leverage\n                                        robots and machines to perform automatic distribution and do some of this easy work,\n                                        so humans can just focus on\n                                        management and monitoring this process. You can see that trade between countries now\n                                        occurs at high speeds. In the past,\n                                        Amazon’s impact could only reach a limited group of people over a long time, but now\n                                        with these scalable AI robot\n                                        distribution centers, it can operate at much faster speeds and can reach people\n                                        globally. In the hands of AI, work is\n                                        more efficient. The other thing is AI is doing cutting-edge research for health.\n                                        Scientists are trying to leverage AI to\n                                        do cancer analysis, diabetes checks and for problems in protein folding. For\n                                        example, Google made a contact lens that\n                                        can help people with diabetes monitor the glucose levels in your body. Before, you\n                                        had to use a needle and blood to\n                                        monitor your glucose levels.\n                                    </p>\n                                    <p>\n                                        In cancer and disease analysis, many experienced doctors have to go over many X-ray\n                                        films [or pathology slides] to get\n                                        enough results to determine if there is cancer. With AI and computer reading\n                                        technology, this can be done by machines\n                                        with higher accuracy. This makes the doctors’ work easier because the machine tells\n                                        them if there is cancer, and the\n                                        doctors just have to double check instead of checking through thousands of films by\n                                        themselves. The other side of AI is\n                                        the challenge that in the future if AI is working in all areas, people have to ask,\n                                        “How can I improve myself to embrace\n                                        these changes and to work together with AI techniques to make my work more efficient\n                                        and essential?”. This is a big\n                                        topic, including AI ethics, or how we use AI. People are doing unbiased learning to\n                                        ensure that the AI is unbiased, and\n                                        there are rules that AI cannot be used by the military.\n                                    </p>\n                                    <h2><strong>What advice would you give to someone who doesn't really\n                                        know what their passion is or what they want to pursue?</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>\n                                        Since you're still young, you can try to do whatever you want to do. The goal at the beginning of your career is to get\n                                        hands-on experience in different areas. It is fine that you don't have the passion at the beginning, but as you're\n                                        trying different things, you're learning. As time goes on, you'll have figured out what you really want to do. Someone\n                                        might say, “Hey, I really want to do something related to program management, I want to talk to people'', then one day\n                                        transfer from being a software engineer to program manager. That is very normal in the industry. I know some people that\n                                        transitioned from being a doctor to computer science. It's very common to change mid-career. When I was at Google, we\n                                        had a medical professor from some university in France join our team who just liked coding. Another engineer would come\n                                        to the office around 3pm, and work until 9pm at night, because she was working as a part-time doctor in a hospital in\n                                        the morning. There are many careers you can do. But just keep trying, you will find what you want to do. I can only\n                                        speak for a computer science major. For some other majors, like in medicine, you will always have to go through the\n                                        process of doing a residency, then many years of practicing to become a doctor. I see computer science as flexible\n                                        because you can transition to other positions. It might not apply to other areas.\n                                    </p>\n                                    <h1 className=\"text-center\">&middot; &middot; &middot;</h1>\n                                    <h2 className=\"text-center\"><strong>Tips for College Students</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>Even as I work in the industry, I still keep learning about time management\n                                        and what my priorities are.

For college students, if\n                                        you can find a good mentor, which is what CCE is doing, I think that is very\n                                        good and meaningful. No matter if they’re\n                                        young professionals, or people already working in the industry for some\n                                        time, they can give you advice. They can set\n                                        examples that college students can see and learn from. Also, try to go\n                                        beyond the university and get some real working\n                                        experience, in terms of an internship.

These interests will\n                                        help you decide which major you want to study more in university, and high\n                                        school students can prepare for it. If you\n                                        are in high school and want to learn computer science, you can do some\n                                        coding projects and online learning to prepare\n                                        for studying computer science. I know some high school students who can do\n                                        projects on their own, like making a mobile\n                                        app. There are many resources out there and maybe through CCE you can build\n                                        these connections!</p>\n                                    <div className=\"text-center\">\n                                        <img className=\"chronicle-pics\" src={expose} alt=\"Expose yourself\" />\n                                    </div>\n                                    <br></br>\n                                    <h2 className=\"text-center\"><strong>Tips for People Interested in Computer Science Career</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>If you are already in the computer science major, focus on the study. I know in US universities, the computer science\n                                        department teaches a lot from theory to real projects. If you finish all the projects and homework with 100% effort, you\n                                        will learn a lot and you can also learn the really basic skills, including data structures, introduction to algorithm\n                                        architecture, and other classics in computer science that are really fundamental and that you will want to learn. For\n                                        other students that are not in the computer science major yet and have additional time, I will say there are two\n                                        options. One is that there are many online courses like Coursera, Udacity, and other online resources, where you can get\n                                        the first step into computer science. The other is if you're still in university, you can try to audit or join a class\n                                        in the computer science department to see whether you like it or not. After one semester you will get more information\n                                        and more of a feeling about whether you really like this field, because there is a lot of coding and coding theory in\n                                        the homework. I think you definitely need to expose yourself to the actual classes and do hands-on learning before you\n                                        can decide whether that's something that you want to go for and to build a good foundation as you prepare for a career in industry.</p>\n                                </Col>\n                                <Col md=\"2\"></Col>\n                            </Row>\n                        </Container>\n                        <Container className=\"main-page text-center\">\n                            <Button href=\"/chronicles\" variant=\"info\">All Chronicles</Button>\n                        </Container>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <Footer />\n            </div>\n        );\n    }\n}\n\nexport default InternshipsAreOpportunities;","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/paul-wong.9cb5de95.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/volunteer.229f5983.png\";","import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport '../App.css';\nimport AppNavbar from '../components/AppNavbar';\nimport Footer from '../components/Footer';\nimport { Container, Row, Col } from 'reactstrap';\n// import ChroniclesHeader from '../components/ChroniclesHeader';\nimport paulwong from '../resources/images/chronicles/paul-wong.jpg';\nimport volunteer from '../resources/images/chronicles/volunteer.png';\nimport psychology from '../resources/images/chronicles/psychology.png';\nimport { Button } from 'react-bootstrap';\n\nclass PsychIsCalling extends Component {\n    render() {\n        return (\n            <div className=\"all-content\">\n                <div className=\"content-wrap\">\n                    <AppNavbar />\n                    {/* <div className=\"blue-container\">\n                        <ChroniclesHeader />\n                    </div> */}\n                    <div className=\"main-page\">\n                        <Container className=\"text-center\">\n                            <h1>Psychology is my Calling</h1>\n                            <h6 className=\"authors\">BY JUSTIN CHOW &middot; RAY CHANG &middot; SELINA YANG &middot; SABRINA TENG &middot; HARRY SIO</h6>\n                            <h6 className=\"date\">Feb 19, 2021 &middot; 4 min read</h6>\n                        </Container>\n                        <Container className=\"text-center\">\n                            <img className=\"chronicle-pics\" src={paulwong} alt=\"Paul's headshot\" />\n                        </Container>\n                        <Container>\n                            <Row>\n                                <Col md=\"2\"></Col>\n                                <Col md=\"8\">\n                                    <br></br>\n                                    <p>Dr. Paul Wong is a Canadian clinical psychologist.

There are many\n                                    aspects of medicine that are very different from what ordinary people imagine a\n                                    medical career to be. Uncovering the mysteries of the human brain or finding cures for\n                                    cancer are not going to be a major part of your training, and your hospital volunteering\n                                    experiences will be very different from a usual day as a healthcare worker. A huge\n                                    aspect of medicine is having to communicate terrible news to an already shattered\n                                    family. As you get more and more accustomed to the practical know-how of taking care\n                                    of a patient, it is possible to become emotionally worn out by seemingly trivial details\n                                    that actually become huge roadblocks to treatment flow, such as health insurance status,\n                                    bed availability of post-acute care facilities, or missing family members who hold the\n                                    power to make decisions for a patient. Think carefully before you apply to medical\n                                    school, and remember to take care of yourself if you are admitted.</p>\n                                </Col>\n                                <Col md=\"2\"></Col>\n                            </Row>\n                        </Container>\n                        <Container className=\"main-page text-center\">\n                            <Button href=\"/chronicles\" variant=\"info\">All Chronicles</Button>\n                        </Container>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <Footer />\n            </div>\n        );\n    }\n}\n\nexport default PsychIsCalling;","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/FengLi.95ea1586.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/build.f7ea0935.png\";","import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport '../App.css';\nimport AppNavbar from '../components/AppNavbar';\nimport Footer from '../components/Footer';\nimport { Container, Row, Col } from 'reactstrap';\n// import ChroniclesHeader from '../components/ChroniclesHeader';\nimport fengli from '../resources/images/chronicles/FengLi.png';\nimport network from '../resources/images/chronicles/network.png';\nimport build from '../resources/images/chronicles/build.png';\nimport { Button } from 'react-bootstrap';\n\nclass YouCanDoThis extends Component {\n    render() {\n        return (\n            <div className=\"all-content\">\n                <div className=\"content-wrap\">\n                    <AppNavbar />\n                    {/* <div className=\"blue-container\">\n                        <ChroniclesHeader />\n                    </div> */}\n                    <div className=\"main-page\">\n                        <Container className=\"text-center\">\n                            <h1>You Can Do This</h1>\n                            <h6 className=\"authors\">BY YUCONG YANG &middot; RAY CHANG &middot; SELINA YANG &middot; SABRINA TENG &middot; HARRY SIO</h6>\n                            <h6 className=\"date\">Mar 12, 2021 &middot; 10 min read</h6>\n                        </Container>\n                        <Container className=\"text-center\">\n                            <img className=\"chronicle-pics\" src={fengli} alt=\"Feng Li's headshot\" />\n                        </Container>\n                        <Container>\n                            <Row>\n                                <Col md=\"2\"></Col>\n                                <Col md=\"8\">\n                                    <br></br>\n                                    <p>Dr. Feng Li is an Associate Professor of Economics at Texas State University.

Since we are both female and Asian, she felt very\n                                        close to me. She was not an economics\n                                        major back then but she later switched to economics. Several years later I got\n                                        contacted by one of my former professors,\n                                        and he said, “Li, do you know what happened to that student of yours? After she\n                                        switched her major to economics, she\n                                        really loved it. She graduated with a 4.0 GPA, and she ended up working for Google.”\n                                    </p>\n                                    <p>\n                                        I like to tell my students that story because sometimes I feel like, out of the\n                                        thousands of students I teach, if I can\n                                        really make a difference in just one student's life, that will be enough. We all\n                                        need mentors along the way, someone\n                                        who's a few years ahead of you, who can give you some insight that will help you\n                                        navigate. Sometimes we don't know for\n                                        sure if our major is the thing that we want to do. Sometimes we don't know what kind\n                                        of jobs will be available to us. So\n                                        I always try to work with young minds because you can do a whole lot with young\n                                        minds as you're guiding them along that\n                                        path.\n                                    </p>\n                                    <h2><strong>That is a very encouraging story.

There, once you get your\n                                        PhD, you go to developing countries and help them design an educational system that\n                                        will work for minority or\n                                        underprivileged students. However, life always throws you curveballs, and I didn't\n                                        end up doing that thanks to a class\n                                        taught by a life-changing professor to me. That professor was a Stanford graduate, a\n                                        sociologist, and also a passionate\n                                        economist. When I was an undergrad, I actually didn’t like economics. For example,\n                                        the supply demand curve. Why are you\n                                        shifting this curve and not that curve? It just does not make any sense to me back\n                                        then. Only after I was around\n                                        23-year-old did I start seeing the beauty of economics and find it\n                                        super-fascinating, and I started to take a lot of\n                                        economics classes. Unfortunately, when I was about to defend my dissertation\n                                        prospect, that professor passed away\n                                        because of cancer. After that difficult period of time, I ended up giving up my\n                                        dream of becoming an education\n                                        specialist and switched over to economics.\n                                    </p>\n                                    <p>\n                                        So that was a really long winding road and coming back to economics, but I think it\n                                        benefited a lot for me. So I would\n                                        actually encourage whoever is reading this, to really think about one thing -- if\n                                        you made some long winding road and\n                                        you feel like this is a diversion from whatever your goal is, or somehow you feel\n                                        that you are doing something that on\n                                        the surface is not consistent with your ultimate goal, it's okay. It is okay to\n                                        fail, and it's okay to fail many times,\n                                        because sometimes those experiences enrich your future. So back to my story, after I\n                                        went through all that trouble and\n                                        circled back to economics, guess what, I actually became one of the research stars\n                                        in my cohort. It is not because I was\n                                        better, but because my previous major gave me insight for new and different\n                                        questions. I am interested in a lot of\n                                        education policy issues that they didn’t get exposed to. When I was in my undergrad,\n                                        I was able to see how teachers\n                                        received their training, so when I started to work as an economist, I can approach\n                                        those education policy research from\n                                        different perspectives. Instead of just focusing on students, I also ask questions\n                                        about teachers. Are we keeping\n                                        teachers in the classrooms? Can we encourage them to become a teacher? How can we\n                                        attract them into teaching? What do\n                                        they have to give up, such as those industry jobs, if they decide to be a teacher?\n                                        Had I started out being a straight up\n                                        economics student, I would not be able to ask those questions.\n                                    </p>\n                                    <p>\n                                        So my message to our readers is to not be afraid, and don’t worry too much if you\n                                        make a mistake as a young person.\n                                        Congratulate yourself on making mistakes because that's actually a great enriching\n                                        experience. I think God has a plan\n                                        for all of us, a great vision for each unique individual. Sometimes I have to listen\n                                        to God's words and ask myself what\n                                        God is trying to tell me. Sometimes I do get frustrated. For example, when my\n                                        professor passed away during my PhD, I\n                                        asked God, “ why'd you kick my professor away when I was a poor grad student? I was\n                                        trying to struggle through the\n                                        program, and I’ve made it so far. Why did you take him away?” I still remember my\n                                        professor's funeral. I was crying. I\n                                        was crying for him and also crying for myself, because it was so devastating.\n                                        Because I was in a different country, and\n                                        I had no idea what my future held, and now my professor was gone. And he was not\n                                        just a professor, but also your friend\n                                        and your great mentor. He had a natural passion for taking care of people, and he\n                                        always brought pots of curry to feed\n                                        students with. He had so much influence on me, and now as I became a professor, I\n                                        think I inherited some of his teaching\n                                        philosophy. I'm telling this story to encourage all of the readers out there --\n                                        don't get discouraged. My professor’s\n                                        death was such a huge stumbling block in my career and it was so disheartening at\n                                        that time. Now when I look back on it,\n                                        it was still difficult, but somehow I made a pass through that, not because I was\n                                        able to but because of my faith in the\n                                        Lord, and I have a God with me. (Of course also with my friends and my husband, who\n                                        was my boyfriend back then.) I just\n                                        want to give a positive message to the readers that every setback can actually be a\n                                        good thing.\n                                    </p>\n                                    <h2><strong>It sounds like life is a learning journey, and that it’s\n                                        normal to make mistakes.</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>\n                                        Yes.

He was an honors student and he was super self-motivated.\n                                        After he graduated, he went to\n                                        Southern Methodist University to get his master masters in economics. He was in his\n                                        first semester of econometrics\n                                        class, which is a very difficult math class, and he was not doing well. In that\n                                        first semester, he would call me and\n                                        asked, “Do you think I can do this?” I said, “yes, you can do this. Okay? For\n                                        anybody you can do this. You're one of our\n                                        best students. You can definitely do this.” But guess what? When he was taking his\n                                        second sequence to that econometrics\n                                        class, he did really well -- he did a stellar job, he entered into a competition,\n                                        and his program actually introduced\n                                        him to some local people and a local company. I also have some students who struggle\n                                        in school, but even so, I’ll\n                                        spotlight talents of theirs and support them. So sometimes we have to have that kind\n                                        of person in our life and just tell\n                                        us that, you can do this, and encourage us along this navigation process.\n                                    </p>\n                                    <h2><strong>Do you have any recommendations on how young people can\n                                        find their support or their mentor?</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>\n                                        The church is a wonderful place to start\n                                        searching for a mentor because that’s where you won’t be judged. Career\n                                        counselors, high school teachers, and professors are also good options because they\n                                        have networks in many industries. I\n                                        think students sometimes overlook that, but they’ve taught hundreds and thousands of\n                                        students prior to you, and they’re\n                                        very familiar with the system because they have helped so many students to navigate\n                                        that system. Also, talk to as many\n                                        staff members as possible on your campus. People often ignore that we actually have\n                                        wonderful staff members. From my\n                                        experience, my university is a Hispanic serving institution. We have a lot of\n                                        Hispanic and Latino staff members who are\n                                        very good resources. Sometimes students have trouble putting food on their table,\n                                        but they didn't know that we have a\n                                        Bobcat pantry program. We also have the wardrobe program, where you can borrow some\n                                        clothing like a suit and tie for an\n                                        interview. There are lots of resources available, but you have to find the right\n                                        people. Find someone who deeply cares\n                                        about your success, who is willing to take the time and energy for you, and that\n                                        person will be your mentor.\n                                    </p>\n                                    <p>\n                                        Start networking when you’re in college. If you start when you begin looking for a\n                                        job, that is already too late. It’s\n                                        difficult to start during the freshmen and sophomore year, because you’re still\n                                        learning to navigate the system. But in\n                                        your junior or senior year, start talking to your professors, and also your parents.\n                                        They may have good connections, and\n                                        even if they don’t know the right kind of people, their friends might.\n                                    </p>\n                                    <p>\n                                        You can also build your professional network by talking to the local community. I\n                                        encourage everyone to volunteer at\n                                        their church, local food pantries, or whatever else you are passionate about. You\n                                        can do this in high school and\n                                        college, and people will see your work ethic overtime. Earning a little income is\n                                        also nice, but the more important\n                                        thing is to know supervisory people who can provide references later on.\n                                    </p>\n                                    <p>\n                                        Possible mentors can also be amongst your peers. Students a couple of years ahead of\n                                        you can offer tips about which\n                                        courses to take, what professors to avoid, and other valuable information. This is\n                                        important to think about in your\n                                        planning if you need a stellar GPA in the future, like for law or medical school.\n                                        Like I said earlier, don’t be afraid\n                                        if you make a few mistakes along the way, but this can help you avoid some towards\n                                        your ultimate goal.\n                                        <div className=\"text-center\">\n                                            <img className=\"chronicle-pics\" src={build} alt=\"build\" />\n                                        </div>\n                                        <br></br>\n                                        So I just gave you a whole bunch of different places. I really think looking for a\n                                        mentor is important in our modern\n                                        days, and you can start that even in high school. However, you will have to try a\n                                        few times before you find your mentor.\n                                        Out of the whole list of people available, maybe only one is really invested in you,\n                                        but that will be enough. You don’t\n                                        need to have a mentor in every area, but rather find which one is passionate about\n                                        your success. For example, I had one\n                                        undergraduate who got an A in my class, but got A+s in her other courses. In that\n                                        case, the other professors saw her\n                                        potential and helped her get to where she wanted to be.\n                                    </p>\n                                    <p>\n                                        Also, While it’s good to plan, it’s important to know that even if you didn’t get to\n                                        where you wanted to be, don’t be\n                                        discouraged. It’s life experience. God trains us to become better people, and gives\n                                        us the perseverance to get through\n                                        troubled times. As you’re building your network, you’re also building friendship and\n                                        getting support. That’s especially\n                                        important in high school and college, because these are formative years and you’re\n                                        trying to find out who you are. We in\n                                        the Chinese American community need to be cognizant of pressure being put on young\n                                        people on getting it right the first\n                                        time. Having a mentor, having friends, and having faith to support you is important\n                                        in dealing with these kinds of\n                                        mental health problems. Organizations like CCE can provide that kind of moral\n                                        support network system. I hope you can see\n                                        that from my story, you will be able to achieve your goals and be happy not just\n                                        because you have money, but because you\n                                        made a difference in someone else’s life.\n                                    </p>\n                                    <h2><strong>There was some media coverage on your research of how to\n                                        train and retain high quality teachers throughout the country.\n                                        Could you share more about that?</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>\n                                        I had worked for one year at Shaanxi Normal University with many student teachers,\n                                        and was thinking of becoming a\n                                        development specialist to work with low income kids and improve their educational\n                                        opportunities. Actually this research\n                                        agenda initially came as a compromise between me and my economics advisor, the first\n                                        person I worked with at the Florida\n                                        Department of Education 15-20 years ago. I had given my professor a list of ten\n                                        potential dissertation topics, but he\n                                        rejected all of them except my last topic, teacher shortage and training. However, I\n                                        realized later on that I had always\n                                        been interested in that topic and the work was actually very interesting.\n                                    </p>\n                                    <p>\n                                        Traditionally a lot of teachers are trained through the college of education, but we\n                                        were studying a specific program\n                                        called the Robert Noyce Scholarship. This program was funded by the National Science\n                                        Foundation, and wanted to recruit\n                                        STEM majors to become K-12 teachers. The first part of the research question was to\n                                        look at the national landscape and\n                                        see how many math and science majors had become teachers in the past 15-20 years.\n                                        The second part asked if the millions\n                                        of dollars given to this program had made a difference in putting these teachers in\n                                        high-need school districts,\n                                        typically low-income schools or those with many African-American or Latino students.\n                                        I was very excited because we’re\n                                        working with many different universities, like the University of West Florida and\n                                        University of Arlington, and with the\n                                        Brookings Institution, a think tank in Washington, D.C.\n                                    </p>\n                                    <p>\n                                        Sometimes ideas take a while to get materialized, so this was around five to six\n                                        years ago. We also had to apply four\n                                        times before we got the funding for the project, so do not be afraid about applying\n                                        for a scholarship and being\n                                        rejected. We will all be discouraged, so put the rejection letter away, let it sit,\n                                        and then go back to it in a week and\n                                        see how you can improve yourself when you apply again. Grant applications like these\n                                        are not easy, even though it might\n                                        look that way when you get them.\n                                    </p>\n                                    <p>\n                                        Even if you don’t get the job or the scholarship, take the opportunity to establish\n                                        your network. Follow up and ask if\n                                        they have any suggestions about how to improve and a general idea of what their\n                                        ideal person looked like. An important\n                                        skill for young people is to be able to communicate like this in a professional way.\n                                        Don’t burn your bridges, because\n                                        they might have a job in the future that you will be a good fit for. Make sure the\n                                        established link is strong, learn,\n                                        and build up that relationship. You could add them on LinkedIn; sometimes people\n                                        share opportunities there, and then\n                                        you’ll be in the know. It’s important to be able to wait. Don’t be discouraged,\n                                        because you learn from failure. Always\n                                        take opportunities that come at you, and you will succeed in the future for sure.\n                                    </p>\n                                    <p>\n                                        It is important to have an open mind and a growth mindset, and I think that can also\n                                        come from the faith. You can turn\n                                        to prayer for improvement and opportunity. For example, you can say “God, I know\n                                        this job you didn't give it to me, but\n                                        tell me what I could do to improve.” Or sometimes you can even just say I can't do\n                                        this. Please give me another\n                                        opportunity. Because a lot of times God can do miracle work that humans cannot. We\n                                        have our limitations. Mentors help,\n                                        but ultimately, I believe our faith sustains us in our dark times.\n                                    </p>\n                                    <h1 className=\"text-center\">&middot; &middot; &middot;</h1>\n                                    <h2 className=\"text-center\"><strong>Tips for High School Students</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>If you’re interested but don’t know if economics is for you, I would\n                                        recommend reading the Freakonomics series (they\n                                        also have a podcast), Naked Economics by Charles Wheelan, Thinking, Fast and\n                                        Slow, and Poor Economics by Esther Duflo\n                                        and Abhijit Banerjee.\n                                    </p>\n                                    <p>\n                                        Also keep in mind that economics is a very broad subject, and is really\n                                        about how people make decisions in their daily\n                                        life. It's not just stock markets -- that's finance. There are lots of\n                                        research questions economists are asking, and\n                                        there are a lot of social sciences. Economics is a lot like physics to a\n                                        STEM major: very theoretical and a necessary\n                                        class to take. Finance is very similar to engineering because engineering is\n                                        very much an applied field, and finance is\n                                        that. That being said, there are still lots of economists that are hired by\n                                        Amazon and all these tech firms because we\n                                        have a lot of very strong abilities to work with data, and our abilities to\n                                        understand people’s purchasing behavior and\n                                        decision-making process.\n                                    </p>\n                                    <p>\n                                        Also look at what economists do.

I grew up in Taiwan, then came to the\n                                        US for college. I studied at Ohio State, then later on I got my master’s at\n                                        the University of Michigan. Throughout my student career, I mostly focused on\n                                        electrical engineering and computer\n                                        science. When I graduated and actually started my career, it was 2008. It was a time\n                                        of financial crisis, so it was\n                                        pretty hard to find a job. I had to do a complete pivot from what I was studying,\n                                        and I actually started my first job in\n                                        sales, focusing on networking. I joined Cisco System, one of the leading vendors for\n                                        networking, and I was in a part of\n                                        the sales associate program. That’s where I started my career in the tech industry.\n                                    </p>\n                                    <p>\n                                        I did a couple of years of sales, then pivoted to a more technical role as a\n                                        technical marketing engineer (TME). The\n                                        interesting part of a sales engineer is that we go very broad but pretty shallow in\n                                        each area. There were so many\n                                        interesting areas in technology, like security, data center, cloud, and I wanted to\n                                        pick one area to really dive deep\n                                        into. That’s why I became a TME, and I chose to focus on data center.\n                                    </p>\n                                    <p>\n                                        After I did that for a couple of years as well, I realized that I'm really\n                                        interested in the business side. As a\n                                        technical person, a lot of the time I wouldn’t get involved with how customers make\n                                        decisions or how we take the product\n                                        to the customer. The technical folks would usually come in after the sale was made.\n                                        That’s where I really got\n                                        interested, so I switched from a technical role to the product manager (PM) role,\n                                        which is more focused on business.\n                                    </p>\n                                    <p>\n                                        In a nutshell, the product manager is like a mini-CEO. A CEO owns the company\n                                        strategy execution and the result.\n                                        Similarly, I will be responsible for pretty much everything about a product or\n                                        product line within the group. That\n                                        includes initial steps like identifying market opportunities and finding where the\n                                        product market fit is. How do we\n                                        build an MVP (minimum viable product)? Where will we be able to get the MVP version\n                                        to the customer? What are some of\n                                        the future features that we should make? How do we scale from the MVP to more like a\n                                        V1, V2? How do we bring this\n                                        product to the overall market; not just the pilot customer, but for the larger\n                                        enterprises out there? I’ve focused my\n                                        career mostly on the B-to-B, the business to business, not so much the product from\n                                        business to consumer.\n                                    </p>\n                                    <p>\n                                        I worked as a product manager for a couple of years. Then I joined AWS about four\n                                        years ago, because I’m really from a\n                                        data center perspective. Cloud is the future; everybody is moving to it. [After\n                                        joining AWS,] I’ve been doing similar\n                                        things as a product manager, but blended with some of the sales skills I had in the\n                                        past. It’s a blended role of\n                                        developing a product with the engineering team and working with the sales team to\n                                        bring it to market and ramp up the\n                                        revenue.</p>\n                                    <h2><strong>Can you talk more about what your specific role is as a\n                                        product manager in AWS?</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>\n                                        A unique feature of being a product manager\n                                        at AWS is that we own what we call product definition. This is asking the\n                                        question of what we want to build. The product manager gets that initial idea\n                                        through market research or getting\n                                        feedback from existing customers. If they recommend we build something, and we see\n                                        enough traction on the same request,\n                                        then we know it is something we should invest in and build.\n                                    </p>\n                                    <p>\n                                        Once we get a sense of what the customer wants, we go back with the engineering\n                                        team. We, as the product manager,\n                                        specifically write a document called PR-FAQ (press release frequently asked\n                                        questions), which basically defines what the\n                                        product is, hence product definition. Other organizations might call it PRD, which\n                                        stands for product requirements\n                                        documents. The very important thing that product managers do is understanding the\n                                        prioritization. The customers will\n                                        always ask for maybe 10 features they want to have, but we have to work with them to\n                                        understand their ranking from one\n                                        to ten. A lot of the time we don’t have the resources or time to build all ten, so\n                                        we have to prioritize. We use the\n                                        term P0 to describe features [or items with the highest priority], meaning that we\n                                        cannot launch the products without\n                                        it. So out of the ten features, how many are P0 functionalities? What’s the cost of\n                                        building them? It’s critical for the\n                                        product manager to figure this out, so we can help the engineers build the correct\n                                        MVP with the initial customer\n                                        traction. In the next iteration, like the V1 and V2, we can build beyond P0 to P1,\n                                        P2, and P3, the later priority\n                                        features.\n                                    </p>\n                                    <p>\n                                        The product manager also has to work with the sales team. First we have to educate\n                                        the sales team about what we’re\n                                        building: what it does, how it benefits the customer, and the outcome they can\n                                        expect to have. Actually, a lot of the\n                                        time it’s the product manager who’s selling the product to the pilot customers. We\n                                        show the benefit to the customer,\n                                        they’ll test it, and if they like it, they’ll adopt the feature or product. After\n                                        the product launch, we need to figure\n                                        out how to scale the product. As a single product manager, I can’t talk to all the\n                                        customers. I have to enable our\n                                        [sales] team to act like me and to be able to sell the product. We also need to\n                                        think about our strategy for scaling the\n                                        product. We could go to the sales team, the partners, and maybe even other channels.\n                                        There’s a lot of thinking about\n                                        business strategy and how to grow revenue. We work with the engineering team to\n                                        build the product and with the sales and\n                                        marketing team to scale the product. We’re responsible for its success or failure\n                                        overall; if it does well, we get the\n                                        glory, but if it fails, we get all the blame too.\n                                    </p>\n                                    <h2><strong>What motivates you to continue working as a product manager?</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>\n                                        [People in AWS share a unique mentality.\n                                        Although] we’re not at the same level as a lot of startups, we often operate\n                                        like a startup, meaning that we’re early vision.

However, product managers have the additional consideration of the\n                                        business side. If you look at a lot\n                                        of the tech industry, the product that’s really successful at the end might not have\n                                        the best tech from an engineering\n                                        point of view, but it’s the best in combining the engineering and business sides.\n                                        What a product manager considers is,\n                                        “how do I find a market fit where I can build a good enough engineering product?”\n                                        Once I have the initial customer and\n                                        can scale, I can continue to refine my product and make it better.\n                                    </p>\n                                    <p>\n                                        It’s a different mindset from an engineer, where we always want to build the best:\n                                        the best code, the best hardware, or\n                                        the best car.

This is where we think Amazon Sage Maker can help.\n                                        Like how AWS was popular among\n                                        enterprises, the value proposition for Cloud is to help offload undifferentiated\n                                        work so you don’t have to manage the\n                                        server.

Customers are interested in building the\n                                        model, validating it, then using the\n                                        model they’ve validated to forecast fraud detections and increase their business\n                                        value. But to achieve that stage, the\n                                        customer has to build a lot of things themselves today, which are undifferentiated.\n                                        They have to build their own machine\n                                        learning platform and standardize on their own best practice, which can create a lot\n                                        of silo. Silo means that every\n                                        department within that organization has a different practice. What Sage Maker is\n                                        offering is a managed platform, meaning\n                                        anything you don’t need to deal with.

What’s most important is developing ways to learn\n                                        new things. Everyone is different,\n                                        and you have to have your own methodology. This is especially important in the tech\n                                        industry, where you will\n                                        continuously need to learn something new. For example, I needed to learn Cloud, then\n                                        Kubernetes, then AIML, and there’s\n                                        always more on the horizon to learn. You also need to be able to do this outside of\n                                        a classroom setting. In school,\n                                        there’s always an agenda, a syllabus, or a professor with you, but you have to be\n                                        able to develop the skills to really\n                                        grasp and master new ideas on your own. In the tech industry or any other STEM\n                                        major, you can’t just rely on the\n                                        knowledge of your major, but you’ll have to have the framework to learn outside of\n                                        it.\n                                    </p>\n                                    <p>\n                                        Another way to prepare is to be broad in what GEC courses you take. A lot of the\n                                        time people will just focus on their\n                                        major, but I highly encourage taking courses outside of that. The product manager is\n                                        a hybrid role; it is technical and\n                                        business.

I had interest in\n                                        courses like psychology, statistics,\n                                        and even some of the languages, like Japanese. It really expanded my horizon and\n                                        helped me develop that methodology to\n                                        learn new things, which helps me in my work environment today.\n                                    </p>\n                                    <p>\n                                        College also gave me confidence. My undergraduate journey was different from a lot\n                                        of folks here. When I came to the US\n                                        for college, I didn’t speak English, so there was definitely a steep learning curve\n                                        for me. As a non-native speaker,\n                                        overcoming the language barrier showed me that language shouldn’t be a blocker for\n                                        me in school or in the workplace.\n                                        That confidence continues to help me refine how I present, communicate, and connect\n                                        with people.\n                                    </p>\n                                    <h2><strong>How did you overcome that language barrier?</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>\n                                        Back in college I was a member of the crew\n                                        team. We would train everyday, so I spent maybe two hours a day with native\n                                        speakers. I gradually picked up what they were saying, and even started to be able\n                                        to read between the lines. That\n                                        exposure to native speakers outside of the classroom really helped me to pick up the\n                                        language. But even after I\n                                        graduated, there was still a gap for me when I presented myself in English. For me,\n                                        joining Toastmaster was a purposeful\n                                        effort into polishing those skills. The pressure of working also helped me improve.\n                                        If I can’t convince others in a\n                                        sale, then it’s hard for me to keep my job. These ways really helped me overcome\n                                        that barrier, especially being on the\n                                        crew team; immersing myself on a daily basis definitely helped me get a jump start.\n                                    </p>\n                                    <p>\n                                        I will also encourage STEM students to join a club, even if it doesn’t relate to\n                                        your major. You’ll learn something\n                                        that’s unexpected, and that could help your career down the road.\n                                    </p>\n                                    <h2><strong>What was your experience pursuing an MBA, after working\n                                        in engineering, sales, and product management for several years?</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>\n                                        So there are two avenues for an MBA.\n                                        Typically people do an MBA after graduating; the golden timing is about three to\n                                        five years afterwards. They might do consulting, investment banking, or financial\n                                        services before then, but they’ve\n                                        identified their career path and they want to go relatively quickly. Some folks want\n                                        to be a product manager, so within\n                                        those 3-5 years, they’ll apply to MBA. Most product managers in the enterprise world\n                                        have an MBA, and while it’s not\n                                        required, having it is definitely a big plus.\n                                    </p>\n                                    <p>\n                                        The other route is for people who work for longer, like me. I worked for almost 10\n                                        years before pursuing my MBA, and I\n                                        pursued that degree because I needed to know how to perform my daily job. Coming\n                                        from an engineering and sales\n                                        background, I didn’t have the training for pricing, modeling, or forecasting. A lot\n                                        of folks that pursue an MBA much\n                                        later in their career come from degrees unrelated to business, like engineering,\n                                        law, or medicine. After working for a\n                                        while, they’ll gradually switch to an executive or more business-oriented role,\n                                        where they’ll learn the business\n                                        discipline and new skills through the MBA.\n                                    </p>\n                                    <h2><strong>Can you share your perspective or advice for college\n                                        students who are not sure about their future directions?</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>\n                                        Data scientists and business analysts are\n                                        pretty hot right now. There are thousands of these job postings, and it’s\n                                        definitely a great way to get into the tech workspace. But I also encourage you to\n                                        rotate around in your first couple of\n                                        years. People can give you their feedback and experience, but it’s really up to you\n                                        to experience it for yourself. It’ll\n                                        take some time for you to really find where you want to launch your career.\n                                    </p>\n                                    <p>\n                                        I didn’t find the product manager role until almost five years after I started\n                                        working, and it took some trial and\n                                        error. I tried sales and I liked it, but I knew I didn’t want my whole career to be\n                                        sales. I tried technical marketing\n                                        engineering, but again, that’s not something I feel like I will build my entire\n                                        career upon. Then I tried product\n                                        management, and I really liked it; it was something I could establish myself and\n                                        launch my career upon. Some people may\n                                        have a very direct mapping after they start a career, and that’s great. But I think\n                                        the majority of folks need that\n                                        trial and error to really find their right career path. Just because data science is\n                                        hot doesn’t mean it’s for\n                                        everybody, right?\n                                    </p>\n                                    <h1 className=\"text-center\">&middot; &middot; &middot;</h1>\n                                    <h2 className=\"text-center\"><strong>Tips for Looking for First Job</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>My path was pretty direct; I just went to school career services. Typically\n                                        most companies, including Amazon, will have\n                                        a preferred education institution they work with. Every year, there will be\n                                        an internship, then a full time job will\n                                        come. You’ll need to be familiar with what your school offers regarding\n                                        career services and what company typically works\n                                        with your school.\n                                    </p>\n                                    <p>\n                                        Another path is mentorship. I didn’t do it when I started my career, but I\n                                        wish I could have. If you kind of know what\n                                        you want to do in your future, a platform like CCE will connect you with a\n                                        mentor who will be able to point you to those\n                                        industry specific events, groups, or LinkedIn to join. You’ll get the\n                                        exposure to see if you want to launch that career\n                                        and what you need to do. For example, what certification do you need to\n                                        have? What kind of courses do you need to take?\n                                    </p>\n                                    <p>\n                                        Besides, note that certification is actually more important than a lot of\n                                        people think. One of the reasons I was able to\n                                        land my job at Cisco is because I happened to have a certification in\n                                        networking, and that really helped me\n                                        differentiate myself from all the other newly grads at the time. We all\n                                        focus on our GPA in school, but we don’t spend\n                                        much time tackling industry certification, right? That can be a pretty\n                                        significant differentiation, especially in the\n                                        first job or internship, since there’s no prior work experience to judge\n                                        applicants by. Having certification will make\n                                        your resume stand out pretty easily.\n                                    </p>\n                                    <p>\n                                        Also, interviewing skills are amazingly useful. Any customer-facing role\n                                        requires the skill to help the customer, but\n                                        most importantly to extract the main idea. It’s not taught at school a lot\n                                        of the time and the importance of this skill\n                                        is often overlooked.</p>\n                                    <br></br>\n                                    <h2 className=\"text-center\"><strong>Tips for High School Students</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>Taking AP courses in high school is one thing you can do. Computer science\n                                        was harder for me in college because I never\n                                        did coding in high school. We were taught all the theory when I grew up in\n                                        Taiwan, but we never actually implemented\n                                        coding. Getting hands-on experience at the high school level will be really\n                                        helpful for college. I saw my peers\n                                        understand what the professor wanted right away while I was still scratching\n                                        my head, and it turns out they had AP\n                                        computer science back in high school. If it’s an interest or major they want\n                                        to pursue, trying out classes in high\n                                        school will definitely give a much faster start in college.</p>\n                                    <div className=\"text-center\">\n                                        <img className=\"chronicle-pics\" src={course} alt=\"Course\" />\n                                    </div>\n                                    <br></br>\n                                    <h2 className=\"text-center\"><strong>Tips for International Students</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>They’re very fortunate in the current time to have so many online courses to take,\n                                        like Coursera.

I just kept going to office hours and tried to figure things out; I\n                                        think my TA really didn’t like me\n                                        because I visited so often. The language and the computer science barrier was pretty\n                                        hard. But international students in\n                                        the 21st century have way more options, it’s just up to them to spend time and\n                                        research. Maybe you only need to take a\n                                        couple courses, or even just a couple of bootcamps, and you’ll get a pretty good\n                                        idea of the language and computer\n                                        skills needed.</p>\n                                    <br></br>\n                                    <h2 className=\"text-center\"><strong>Career Advice for Students</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>For folks interning in the tech industry, there are definitely different ways to be\n                                        involved in it; you don’t really\n                                        need to be in computer science.

Something I always tell people is, you want to do something you\n                                        like. It could be a lot of pressure, it\n                                        could be a lot of stress. But at the end of the day that has to be something that\n                                        motivates you and that you enjoy\n                                        doing.

He is the ex-founder of Caseology, a\n                                        CPG brand bootstrapped from Zero to $144M in total revenue. He has served more than 6 million\n                                        customers, and was the top 10 Global Amazon Seller in 2017. He runs a faith-driven business, which is\n                                        on a mission to support eCommerce brands through growth capital and operations support. After being\n                                        saved by Grace from the Lord, Mr Kim believes that we are more than enough to make a difference in\n                                        this world, and we should always give back by serving others.</p>\n                                    <h1 className=\"text-center\">&middot; &middot; &middot;</h1>\n                                    <h2><strong>How would you describe yourself and what you're doing now professionally?</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>Our area of focus is eCommerce. A lot of eCommerce owners start as a side job -- there’s actually no “eCommerce” profession yet, no major consumer goods, so it’s an interesting growing part of the business world. I’ve been doing it for 11 years, making products, creating value for customers, and fixing their problems. So, in overall business, I would say I am pretty experienced in problem solving. </p>\n                                    <h2><strong>Can you be more specific and describe what kinds of problems that you solved?</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>When we started, I didn’t even know how to import or export consumer products, so I would get stuck there. All my products got held in customs, and I didn’t know how to get them out. That was a problem we had to solve. In addition, we had to solve capital problems because no one wanted to loan or invest in our consumer goods business. With no history, investors are scared of investing, because there’s too much risk that they’ll have to use all the cash on inventory. We also had to solve marketing issues; it’s not just about finding good products, but also how to sell the product. At the end of the day, any business has to solve problems with different perspectives. Do I look at this issue with an investor perspective, or a consumer perspective? We learned that my opinion is not always the answer, there are other people’s expectations out there. When we got stuck and didn’t know what to do, really believing in ourselves, that we were meant for this, helped us not give up. We’ve had many crises, like near bankruptcy, but we overcame them to even reach the top 2 sellers on Amazon. We’ve grown from zero to 120 employees. At first we were just ordinary people, with first time jobs and no background, but because we were professional and did what we needed to do, we’re not scared of any problems and are solid.</p>\n                                    <h2><strong>There are many things you have to learn on the fly to be an entrepreneur, and that could be an intimidating roadblocks to people who want to get into entrepreneurship. Could you share some of your insights and advice on how you addressed these roadblocks?</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>Sure. So the thing is that, we can’t solve every problem, so we [first] categorize [our problem]. [Is] fear [the problem that we are facing]? Are we scared of trying it? Or do we really think we can do it? We call that faith or confidence -- in Christian terms it will be faith, and to nonbelievers we just use the word confidence, right? So I think it's really getting rid of the fear and really going to the visionaries stage. Do you think you can really do it when we start picturing? Sometimes, even though we don't have the capacity, we start picturing what it would be like and we start getting excited. [For example,] what do you think you would do if you win the lottery? When we think of the lottery, we start smiling and we're like, ‘Oh my gosh. I can win the lottery.” Similarly, we start imagining when we're solving a problem. A lot of people don't imagine what it would be like after you solve it, but we start setting that as the goal. Like making a goal for a problem, going backwards and not being afraid of failure because the plan doesn't always work.</p>\n                                    <p>The key thing was the way we treat failure. Do we treat failure like a failure or do we treat failure as learning? As long as we’re treating failure as the fuel or steps or learning, then there is no “failure”. We'd learn as much as we can and share the learning. Every time we learn, I think our perspective gets bigger. Sometimes, God is trying to teach us. Every failure for us has a meaning, so we try to treat failures as learning. [With that mindset,] the journey becomes more enjoyable -- we try to tackle as many problems, possibly learn and enjoy it because it's good muscle for us at the end of day, and we just take it a step at a time.</p>\n                                    <p>The other thing is, sometimes we have to accept the door being closed [by the Lord]. Sometimes we may think, “oh, if we do this plan then we can do that”, or “if I get this partner we can get big deals.” Sometimes it just doesn't work, and we have to accept that it is not meant for us right now, and maybe there is a different way. Even though we actually had the power to force open the door and get that deal if we really wanted to, sometimes God doesn't want that. Every choice that we make has a consequence or reward. Maybe we can force open the door and get whatever we want, but eventually we [may] feel the [internal] conflict. So I think these days, we try to make it more peaceful, natural and not forceful. When we include God [in our decision making], problem solving becomes more natural and enjoyable. We may think we are stronger than Him or think we are more capable, but that leads to feeling lonely later down the road. So we try to ask [Him] a lot. We are faith-based business, and God always leads us to every choice we make. When we include Him, we become more mature and we get to learn when we're in control versus when we want Him to control stuff.</p>\n                                    <div className=\"text-center\">\n                                        <img className=\"chronicle-pics\" src={confidence} alt=\"confidence\" />\n                                    </div>\n                                    <br></br>\n                                    <h2><strong>What is the driving force behind your work? What makes you passionate and decide to pursue entrepreneurship, and particularly in eCommerce?</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>I think what drives me is the journey of faith. I learned a lot about why God mentions faith so much in the Bible. On my journey and others’, a lot of people forget what God does for them, or the help they receive. I’m really grateful for the change that happened in my life before and after this entrepreneurship. Before, I had nothing, even near bankrupt. I didn’t have a working permit, so I was basically illegal. I wasn’t actually good at anything, and my grades were pretty bad. I really felt like I was nothing, but now I’m completely changed. I can take care of the people I care about, and there are a lot of people who believe in me. I really believe that everything that happened was 100% through God, because I alone just wasn’t capable. So my driving force is that I owe Him my life. I remember what he did for me. I remember who I was. I remember the things that I overcame.</p>\n                                    <p>Thankfully, through that journey I learned His heart, and how much He wants people to have faith in Him. As much as I appreciate the people who believe in me, I learned how much it means [to God] when we believe in Him. You get to appreciate people who believe in you more than you believe in yourself. I think it is a very encouraging feeling that God wants to have a relationship with us, so I really believed in him and actually appreciated him. There’s this idea that God doesn’t pick the most qualified or perfect people, but qualifies the called instead. As long as you believe your call, you don’t have to be qualified or perfect. I really think my journey is a testimony to that, because I was nothing close to perfect. I was able to see through him and the business, it's pretty amazing because I wouldn't have thought of all these achievements or these ideas. A lot of the time, I really didn't come with the idea. It was like, it happened, and God opened the door. At the end of the day, [I just want to] remember what He did for me and know that I owe Him everything.</p>\n                                    <h2><strong>Can you share some examples of how your faith in God contributes to your work?</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>You know it’s God when you get ideas that you never could have thought of on your own. You know who you are, you know how smart you are. Ideas where you think, “wow, this definitely isn’t mine,” happen when you ask Him. There’s a lot in asking God for help and for blessing, and then actually acting on what he gives.</p>\n                                    <p>At one point, we didn’t have any money in the business, so we had to close many, many times. Every other month or so, we were going to go bankrupt, but God would provide investment opportunities that kept us going. We wouldn’t be doing well, but we weren’t in fear, because God took care of us so many times. So we diligently and faithfully act as if we’re not going to close, because we didn’t get this far to close. Believe you’re on the journey; you’re here to impact. As long as you’re prepared and act faithfully, God gives opportunities. You know it’s God, because we didn’t send that email or make that call; we didn’t ask other people for anything, we only asked God. Then these things would come and keep us alive.</p>\n                                    <p>What was really helpful was knowing when it was God versus when it was you. It’s important because you have to glorify God when you know it’s God. Don’t take his credit. Tell people that there were things we did right, but it wasn’t you who made that call, it was really God. We might be afraid of how people will receive it, but just boldly saying that makes a huge difference.</p>\n                                    <h2><strong>What kind of people do you look for to join your team? What are characteristics for people who want to succeed in a startup or entrepreneurship environment?</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>In our company, we look for people who know how to be thankful. A lot of people are just complaining about life in general, from the smallest to the biggest things. We’re drawn to complaining, so it’s very rare to find thankful people who make the most out of potential moments of complaint. It’s finding meaning in a bad situation, and deciding to be thankful. Deciding to be thankful when a bad thing happens to you is actually an active faith, and we look for that because we like to serve. We really care about serving others, and we expect you to serve as well. If you don’t know how to be thankful, you’re forcefully serving, and it’s not coming from you. Thankful people also create good energy and positivity. They also remember what they received and what we taught them.</p>\n                                    <p>The second thing we look at is how self-centered you are. There are very egocentric people that only talk about themselves when they’re in a group, and they don’t ask how others are doing. We don’t like working with these people, because when they solve problems, they only look at it from their perspective. They don’t have the listening skills to understand and feel emotions towards customers or partners. Very self-centered people can’t see beyond themselves, so we’re not attracted to that.</p>\n                                    <p>The third thing would be proactive and reactive action. We’re naturally wired to want to follow, but instead of being in an environment where you follow, can you be an environment where people will want to follow you? Even if they’re new, there are proactive people who are constantly asking. Asking itself isn’t wanting to follow, it’s wanting to observe, and you’re creating a shift in the energy. When you’re being thankful, serving, asking, and doing, as a new person, you create lots of positive energy for the existing people. Then we tend to shift to that person. We see the potential in them, we want to grow them, and we believe that they’ll create a good environment for others to constantly multiply in. We care more about wanting to grow, change and impact, and a little less about the skill sets. Of course, we need a certain amount of those skill sets, but we were people with huge drive, not just skill sets. So we believe in the environment you create first, and the skill you have second.</p>\n                                    <p>We also like people with good habits. Habits are very hard to break. We try to hire based on [the] environment [they create] or [their] habits, because through that the work can be learned. We can [always] figure out [the issues if it is just the lack of] the skills, but it’s a lot harder to [figure things out if the problem comes from the wrong] environment [they create] or [the lack of good] habits.</p>\n                                    <h2><strong>The giving and receiving and positivity of your company culture fits very well with CCE’s mission as well! That’s a different perspective, focusing on the culture and people, which is really important since that’s who you interact with daily.</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>Yeah. I just want to add a little bit. These are the things that will help us find who’s the right person for us. There have to be two things: the right person and the right seat. It’s not the right skill; it’s the right seat. If you know it’s the right person, we have to move them around to find what matches them in terms of skill set and the role itself. A wrong person doesn’t fit in any seat though, and we have to get them out of the company. They’re going to be a cancer to the company, and it’s just not going to work. It has to be the right person first, and if they’re right, there’s a chance we can find a different role or seat for them. That’s a lot easier of a fix than trying to make a wrong person right; it just doesn’t work. Shengming mentioned something I really liked, which is that we value picking the right soil. If it’s the right soil, it’ll grow really well. But if it’s just totally the wrong soil, even the best seed won’t grow in it. But sometimes, even giving a little bit in the right soil will grow a lot.</p>\n                                    <p>One person at our company was just like that. We gave them a little information, and he absorbed everything. We don’t have to give 20 hours of training, just a little, and he actually makes more out of what we learned.</p>\n                                    <h2><strong>How do you manage to balance entrepreneurship with your own personal life?</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>I’m actually pretty bad at it. In the past I would do everything that came into my lap, so the only choice was to sleep less and just do more, but I learned later that we get burnt out really quick. So I think we have to find what we’re weak at, and start making partners or hiring the right people that will cover those weaknesses. Now we try to do what’s impactful, and you do that by not making it perfect, so we can keep moving.</p>\n                                    <p>A lot of people want it to be perfect, but mini-progresses are what’s important. There’s this concept I really like that Andrew Wilkinson shared. People try to make a car, but to make a car, you need the frame, the engine, the pipes, the wheels, and after you’re finished, then you can go. Instead of that, what worked for us was to make a skateboard, then a scooter, then a bike, then a car. You want to make progress as you go, instead of trying to make it perfect. We get overwhelmed when we do things that aren’t impactful, so we don’t make progress. We have to make mini progresses to get data; we fail and we fix. We need time to go through cycles of learning instead of ending up making one big fat failure. So instead of making a bold break, we should scale it down to a smaller version, so we can learn and keep making a more progressive learning path.</p>\n                                    <p>It’s also important to delegate as you go. One thing we learned is if you try to do everything yourself, you’re not going to get anywhere; you could go far, but not further. Knowing how to get there with people was key to getting there faster. People might say working with other people will slow them down, and that may be true, but you can’t get far without it. So we spent time training, teaching, and trying to find people that are like us.</p>\n                                    <p>Another thing that happened with time was that I cut off a lot of people in my life, and created a circle around the people that helped me. It was painful in the beginning, but you have to surround yourself with the right people. I think we’ve all heard that from somewhere, but I didn’t listen to it. I really valued every relationship I had, but I realized there were some that slowed me down a lot. Or if you spend less time with them, you don’t have to cut ties completely, and then you can visit or help them back. To give you an extreme example, I had to cut my relationship with my family, because they were really hurting me. But now I’m really close with them, and we’re way closer than before. All the scars are healed and everything is much better.</p>\n                                    <p>Knowing how to do that, delegating and being with the right people, is very helpful and balancing. If you’re tired, just don’t do work, and do what would re-energize you. Sometimes people say I’m a workaholic, and even though work makes me happy, if I knew I was getting in over my head, I have to stop. If you know something’s good for you, and you don’t want to do it, most of the time you should do it. Healthy food normally isn’t super tasty, but you need to eat it. I try to focus on what I have to force myself to do. We naturally tend towards comfort and laziness, but cutting those and doing what’s good for you, even if it’s painful, really helps to get the balance we actually want.</p>\n                                    <p>One thing we teach at our company is called “counter.” For example, we really care about giving back, but how much are we really doing to give back? So here is where we counter: “we know we care, but we’re not doing it. So we’re going to do it.” We analyze ourselves, and help analyze other people. For example, “I know you care about working out, but you’re not doing it, so let’s find a way where you’re going to work out.” So with “counter”, we try to practice the healthy things that help us. Other people don’t even have to ask you what you do and don’t need to do, because if you think about it, we already know how to counter ourselves, so we just need to focus on getting that balance.</p>\n                                    <a href=\"#\" id=\"confidence\"></a>\n                                    <h1 className=\"text-center\">&middot; &middot; &middot;</h1>\n                                    <h2 className=\"text-center\"><strong>Tips for International Students</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>I was born in Korea but went to kindergarten in Australia, elementary in Brazil, and then middle school in Korea. I went to high school in the US, but in between I went back and forth to Korea. So on average, it was rare for me to be in one place for more than two or three years. It was usually one to two, and then we kept moving to different places, because of my father’s job as an international trader. So I did have an identity crisis, as well as a language problem. It was hard for me to make friends I’d get used to. So when we went to the states, I asked my dad, “I wanna stop moving, I wanna settle down and make friends.” But since I was young, I don’t think I knew what I was asking. For us to stop moving, he would have to quit his job, and that would make us illegal. So we came into the states legally, and then became illegal.</p>\n                                    <p>I was able to go to public school and graduate from college without a Social Security number, but I couldn’t work without one. I was trying to be a dentist, and I didn’t know I couldn’t be one until later in college. That’s when I started working 5 jobs, like as a waiter or in a warehouse; any jobs that would pay me, since I couldn’t get a legitimate job. That led me to start a business. I had to pay a ton of taxes, but I could still start one without a social security number.</p>\n                                    <p>There’s always a way. I could have made an excuse out of the situation, but there’s always a way, if you just don’t give up. Like I said earlier, believing you are meant for something, and that you didn’t come this far to not have an opportunity, makes your story and your faith stronger. It makes you more capable, because you overcame more than what others had to. It’s a good challenge to have, and you’ll be a testimony to not having any excuses. I really think the people who overcome more will be more successful in general. The more issues, the better the chances.</p>\n                                    <p>I was also really bad at words, but if you can’t speak, you can’t be a CEO, right? So there were a lot of obstacles for me; I was Asian, I didn’t have a Social Security number, etc. But it didn’t matter; those were just opportunities for me to find a different path. I think that’s what made us rely on God more, since we couldn’t rely on the benefits. We had nothing which we could have done by ourselves, so we just had to keep asking God; there were no other options. The door He opened was better than the loan, it was better than anything. There’s always a way out. Asking God first and acting on what you asked is better than just having privileges.</p>\n                                    <p>The first time God helps you, it’s like, “wow! God, thank you!” But if he keeps doing that for many years, you just know he’s going to take care of you, and you become confident. Since God has opened so many doors for me, I’m more confident, and I don’t care if it doesn’t happen the way I want, because He always has a better door or strategy. Any opportunity or partnership you get will go peacefully, because of what I call, a bold, humble confidence. You don’t need to be cocky, but you have to have extreme confidence; it is or it isn’t. Faith and confidence align. With that, even if you’re a new person in a new place, that can still be an environment where you can make a difference. People can feel that positive energy and they’ll be attracted to it.</p>\n                                    <p>Sometimes people will just have things they want to look for, and if you don’t fit that criteria, you don’t have to be there; there might be a better place. Just know that you are more than enough; you are chosen by God, and you came here not to fail, but to make a difference. Have that confidence. People should look for you, not you looking for where you want to go. It’s a big shift, but I really believe in that. After seeing what He did for me for so many years and even to other people, I see successful people having that confidence and having that super strong relationship with God. They don’t always come from a huge successful background; normally it’s the opposite. So just have that bold, humble confidence.</p>\n                                    <a href=\"#\" id=\"ecommerce\"></a>\n                                    <br></br>\n                                    <h2 className=\"text-center\"><strong>Tips for People Interested in eCommerce or Entrepreneurship</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>If you’re interested, I really recommend pursuing entrepreneurship. You get to find a version of you you never thought you had. It’s like being a parent, but fast-tracked 20 years or so if you’re young. Taking care of employees is kind of like raising a kid, so I started raising kids, my business, when I was 25. You learn to be mature and a leader, because you have to do business. Even if you hired people of a similar age, you just naturally mature faster in your position. You can’t act dumb, you can’t act stupid, and you know that because people get hurt. You become more aware, more responsible, and you get to learn the necessary survival skills. You don’t have to have a big business, but you learn so much in that position that you wouldn’t get in any other job. You might if you’re high up in a different company, but with entrepreneurship, you get to see all of it; you face reality, and you get that raw experience.</p>\n                                    <p>You’re on your own, but you just can’t do it alone, so I think that’s an opportunity for you to meet God. You get to experience and be with Him a lot more, and you just became this version of you faster than any other job.</p>\n                                    <p>eCommerce is interesting compared to others. For restaurants you need a recipe, to do any other business you need cash. But with eCommerce, you just need the right product and have a few customers. You can start it as a side thing, then make it into a main thing. You don’t have to know code, you don’t have to know design; there’s a way to start without being perfect. You can learn as you go on how to be better and how to make an impact. That’s why I’m still in eCommerce. Now I’m trying to help other eCommerce owners get to the next level, because I know they can’t do everything on their own for long.</p>\n                                    <p>So for entrepreneurship, first, you get the experience, but if the business does really well, you’ll get paid more than any other job. What I would tell my past self and every entrepreneur is to run a business like you’re going to exit. When you exit, you generate a lot of wealth. And to exit, you have to run the business clean, you have to make it investable, and not make yourself the focus of the business. Buyers like businesses where they’re hands-off, so they’re basically buying cash flow. To be hands-off, you have to know how to systematize. So with your exit in mind, you would run a standard of a good, healthy business, and when you exit, you basically get paid a couple years up front. If it’s a 4x exit, it means you fast-tracked four years. Then as you constantly build and exit businesses, you’re saving five, ten, twenty years of your life, fast-tracking faster than anyone else.</p>\n                                    <p>I’m in my 11th year now, but I didn’t know all that before. A lot of people told us to expedite when we were super successful, but I didn’t see why we should exit when we’re doing well. But then the debt crisis hit, so you never know what will happen. It’s like when you go to Vegas; you’re not going to want to leave the table when you made the most. But I think exiting is helpful, and when you do, you can really serve the people you like. You could buy Ferraris, but the biggest happiness is when you get to help others in a way where you would have never thought you could help. Definitely give back to God as well, and He will bless you even more.</p>\n                                    <p>Rick Warren’s testimony is huge. He gives back 90% and lives off of 10%, but his 10% is so big. He constantly practices giving and giving, but he also receives. He keeps getting, because God can trust him in serving others. With entrepreneurship, you’re creating your own vision. If you put God into that formula, you’ll see things you would have never seen before, and become some who you would never have thought you could become. We have our own choice, and we’re not building someone else’s empire. We get to build a part of God’s empire.</p>\n                                    <div className=\"text-center\">\n                                        <img className=\"chronicle-pics\" src={ecommerce} alt=\"ecommerce\" />\n                                    </div>\n                                    <br></br>\n                                    <h2><strong>Could you give a quick definition of what you mean by “exit”?</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>Exiting means selling your business. In the US, it’s in terms of profit. Depending on the trend or healthiness of your company, businesses like software companies can be over 10X, meaning you get 10 times of one year’s profit upfront. Simply put, it’s annual profit times whatever multiple. If your trend is up and down, then your multiple is going to go lower. If your trend is flat, then you’ll get a little lower. If your trend is very attractive, then you get more. There are different ways to value businesses, but in eCommerce it’s 3-6, and it’s going up every year, since eCommerce is getting more and more popular. Previously there was no way for ecommerce to exit, but now there is. There’re always exits for software companies though.</p>\n                                    <p>Exiting could also include fundraising. When there’s fundraising, you can exit your shares partially, and you don’t have to sell the whole thing. Even restaurants can exit. Just make your trend healthy and stable, have a consistent customer base, and you can exit 2-4X, and fast-track.</p>\n                                    <p>If you get really good at it, you’ll realize you’re good at problem solving in any business, it’s all somewhat similar. It’s about the environment, the management skills, the organization, making the books clean, and knowing how to market. I would perfect one industry, and then go to other industries. It’s like buying a house, knowing how to fix it, then selling it. As long as you know how to fix the house, you could buy any house in the world. That’s what I call problem solving. If you know how to fix it, you can fix any business.</p>\n                                </Col>\n                                <Col md=\"2\"></Col>\n                            </Row>\n                        </Container>\n                        <Container className=\"main-page text-center\">\n                            <Button href=\"/chronicles\" variant=\"info\">All Chronicles</Button>\n                        </Container>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <Footer />\n            </div>\n        );\n    }\n}\n\nexport default TheBiggestHappiness;","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/M_bannerImage2.8e1176f4.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/TimeLine2022.d350c911.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/SoaringEagleStory.654528b7.png\";","import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport '../App.css';\nimport AppNavbar from './AppNavbar';\nimport Footer from './Footer';\nimport { Container, Row, Col, Button } from 'reactstrap';\n\nimport banner from '../resources/images/application/M_bannerImage2.jpg';\nimport timeline from '../resources/images/application/TimeLine2022.png';\nimport soaringeaglestory from '../resources/images/application/SoaringEagleStory.png';\nimport cloud from '../resources/images/application/Cloud.png';\nimport web from '../resources/images/application/Web.png';\nimport UX from '../resources/images/application/UX.png';\n\nclass Application extends Component {\n    render() {\n        return (\n            <div className=\"all-content\">\n                <div className=\"content-wrap\">\n                    <AppNavbar />\n                    {/* <img width=\"100%\" src={banner} alt=\"banner\" /> */}\n                    <div class=\"banner-section\">\n                        <img width=\"100%\" src={banner} alt=\"banner\" />\n                        <Button className=\"btn-orange apply-button-4\" size=\"lg\" color=\"warning\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfEBdA-4XQf5Od-JdzWkbVQH8_pdIWd9_a_sLrswNVQoimmVQ/viewform?usp=sf_link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Apply Now</Button>\n                    </div>\n                    <img width=\"100%\" src={soaringeaglestory} alt=\"soaringeagle\" />\n                    <div id=\"grey-section\">\n                        <Container>\n                            <Row>\n                                <Col md=\"3\"></Col>\n                                <Col md=\"6\">\n                                    <h5><strong>Here at I FLY YOUNG CCE, we want to help you leave</strong></h5>\n                                    <h5><strong>the ground and learn to soar.

Since graduating from UCLA in 2002, Cheung has worked in numerous environments where he learned how to adapt and nurture his professional skills. After living much of his life in California and specifically, the Bay Area, Cheung recognizes the importance of giving back to his community. As a mentor with CCE, he is able to share his knowledge with new generations of young professionals. </p>\n                                    <h1 className=\"text-center\">&middot; &middot; &middot;</h1>\n                                    <h2><strong>How would you describe your profession in your own words?</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>My profession right now is working at Intel as a software test engineer. Part of my primary role is to make sure the hardware and software works properly before the release. Prior to Intel, I worked at a startup company called Barefoot Networks, and then before that, I was at Cisco for about 11 years. All these companies have a common industry and theme, which is network equipment. Basically, the products are related to testing on the router and switches, whether it’s in the enterprise network or in the data center network.</p>\n                                    <h2><strong>Why did you choose to pursue this path?</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>I went to high school in Cupertino, and my high school had very famous alumni. It mainly included Steve Jobs, so we used to have computer labs full of Mac computers and lots of tech donated by the Apple Company. And believe it or not, it’s also because I watched a movie about hackers. I thought it was really cool to help defend the network and be the network police.  All of those are why I started looking into computer science, particularly the networking field. But gradually I felt that maybe it was too overwhelming to be a network police, and I found my other interests in creating a solution for customers and how all the devices are connected to each other, from the server to the Internet. So after graduation, I went to take a Cisco certification course to learn all the different networking protocols. For my first enterprise job, I landed with Cisco. That's how I started to learn more about the details of how to test different protocols, as well as how to use the computer science knowledge that I learned from university to help with manual testing. </p>\n                                    <p>Manual testing involves a lot of time and human resources, and lots of times that testing could be repetitive. Let's say a new feature gets introduced. We usually would go through the testing cycle for the new feature, but eventually in the future we would need to test it across different new releases, so that's when we start needing to automate the testing. Early on, we used the TCL language for automation, but now the industry standard has moved to Python automation. It helps a lot because it could be the same protocol, but we are testing against different hardware or different software releases. So once we can have the same test case or test methodology, for the automation and script, we could put in a different device or different software release under test, and make sure that the same quality or the same profile works. </p>\n                                    <h2><strong>What are some differences that you noticed along with the change in programming language? </strong></h2>\n                                    <p>Going from TCL to Python is like going from C to C++. Traditionally lots of programs are written in C or in a more linear style of programming, and then eventually it's improved to an object-oriented type of programming. TCL is very easy to learn because its main purpose is for scripting. It's very simple, especially for CLI (Command Line Interface) testing. Basically you send a command and then you get some output. Then from the output, you parse through different interesting values and keys, and make sure that the output is as expected. Now, why did it change to Python? Python is a newer language and it's object-oriented. It has the advantage of more re-usability of the code. For example, there may be one feature you can write into the same object, and then you can provide different functions to test from the protocol itself.</p>\n                                    <div className=\"text-center\">\n                                        <img className=\"chronicle-pics\" src={resource} alt=\"resource\" />\n                                    </div>\n                                    <h2><strong>How much of what you learned in college was applicable for your job?</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>I’d say that now I use about 20% of the actual knowledge I learned in university, like from textbooks and lectures. But how to look for resources, how to look for information; those are the skills I still use today. In university, you learn the new technology and then you learn how to gather information, whether it’s from your professor, from your friend, or from the Internet. That skill is actually much more important than remembering all the different protocols or memorizing the formulas from the textbook.</p>\n                                    <h2><strong>Do you have any suggestions on how someone can take action and develop this skill?</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>At the first job I had in Cisco, I was mainly doing network testing. But my boss actually asked me to write a tool to do a weekly status report, so the team could fill out the form and install that information in the database. That was something that I didn’t expect to do as a network tester. But the Bible says that we should honor those who are in leadership positions, and be humble and obey, as long as it's within God's word. So at that time, even though I felt that it sounded like a janitor's job to do this type of framework because it's not a part of my job description, I still went for it. </p>\n                                    <p>So basically I went on Google and saw how to set up my SQL database, and how to write a Perl script, which I hadn’t learned before, and eventually built a tool to help with the test status report. In testing, we also have a bug report; whenever there is an issue with the code, we have a bug. Then there's also some bug trends that we have to analyze. So with that tool, it also helps with analyzing the incoming or outgoing bug trend, which helps my manager to plan better for the next release or project. It also helps him to better know how to allocate engineering resources in different projects. </p>\n                                    <p>From that experience, I learned this language and how to build a database. It actually helped me to bless I Fly Young when there was a need, by using that skill to work on the website. So I feel that it was an experience where I learned to be humble and to not complain about what the manager is assigning me to do. You never know what skill or knowledge you may learn from that experience, and if you may be able to use it for your next project, next job, or even in serving other people.</p>\n                                    <h2><strong>What is your favorite aspect of your job?</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>To be honest, at one point in my career, I felt that a career was just a job. Sometimes I felt that as long as I could finish my assignments and finish all my tasks, that was it. So I had been struggling to find a passion in the career itself. In the first job that I had, I had a lot of passion; I wanted to pick up all these new technologies, I wanted to learn all the things that I had not learned before, I wanted to be the most efficient person in the team and help the team be successful. I’m not sure when, but at one point, that job had just become a job. It felt more like completing a task and taking the money to feed the family, and the days just went by.</p>\n                                    <p>Another point is that I usually feel that I don't want to spend much time at my job, because I know that I want to serve God more. So I may use some of the work time to maybe prepare for Sunday school or home group messages, or to just get in touch with people. But I think in one of the teachings, I learned that we should not separate our faith from the [workplace], and that we should also be excelling in our [workplace], in our career, instead of just being a normal person that works.</p>\n                                    <p>Joining CCE has also helped me because I've always refused to take responsibility. I feel that it's really hard for me to take the lead; because once you try to lead and be in a leadership position, whether in work or at church, there will be some responsibility, or other people that rely on you. But I feel that after joining CCE, my mindset has changed. I feel like God wants to raise me up. I guess he's trying to teach me to be a leader, not just because the position is a promotion, but it's more about being able to train more leaders or to train more people where I can pass on my experience to them. </p>\n                                    <p>I do feel that there have been some changes within the last few years. Even though I have not put in so much effort at work, for some reason God still blessed me and raised me up into the team leader position. I guess it's also because I have a passion to help people, so whenever my teammates come ask me any questions, as long as it's within my reach and as long as I can answer them, I will try to go out and help people.</p>\n                                    <p>In the past, I never wanted to lead a project because I refused to take that responsibility, but I feel that God wants to change me. Gradually, he wants me to take more responsibility and to train or mentor more people so I can be a blessing for the teammates. And then also in CCE, that's where I got called to be a mentor to the younger generation through my experiences, whether in career or through technical things like the different languages that you asked about. I feel that God has a plan in everyone's career, for it not just to be a job where you make money and feed your family, but there's purpose in a career to be a blessing to other people. </p>\n                                    <h2><strong>Could you elaborate more on how you became involved in CCE and what your role is?</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>So there was one conference that I attended, called the Level Up conference hosted by @Cloud. I'm not sure why I signed up. I think that it was during that period of time when I had a mindset change, when I started to feel that I wanted to bring my faith into my career and excel in my career. So that's why I signed up for the Level Up conference. During that conference, I saw lots of people who shared on the stage. They did have a passion for their career, but they're not consumed by their career. They actually use their career experience to bless all the people who are younger and fresher in their experience like I do. So that's when I saw that there's a need for giving and receiving, and this culture really resonated with me.</p>\n                                    <p>So the track that I joined in @Cloud, the Level Up conference, is called Apostle Leadership, and it was led by Shengming and another brother. It was that time when I saw Shengming’s vision about the three ducks. If you saw the picture on either his presentation or his icon, there are three ducks. So there's one in front, there's one in the middle, and then there's one at the end, walking in a straight line. And he asked, “Who is the leader in this picture?” It could be the one that's leading in front, it could be the one in the middle, or it could be the one that's sitting in the back. So I felt that that was a very interesting discussion, because I would typically walk right at the very end, because I like to oversee everything, and I don't like to walk as the first one. I felt  that during the discussion itself, God was also telling me, “Why don't you try to lead from the front?”</p>\n                                    <p>So that's when I started to pray for courage, whether it’s in the mentorship position or taking the lead in part of the vision that CCE offers. I do feel that my passion is to help people and to serve the younger generation, even the children themselves, and that's why I started to join the CCE meetings and the platform.</p>\n                                    <p>When Shengming asked me if I would like to be part of the Career Professional Council, I thought it was from the supporting position, because I was mainly doing I Fly Young support from the back end, like the G Suite set up and everything else for the online meetings. But I guess Shengming also saw something in me when he asked if I wanted to join. He saw my hesitation since I don't want to lead in the front. But I think that's exactly what God wants to mold and work on, and therefore I prayed about it and decided that, “OK, yeah, maybe I should try and take on more responsibility.” I believe that's why God created me to have a passion to work with the younger generation and blessing them. I believe I have a lot of experience that I want to share, and I have a lot of skills that I could pass on to people who are less experienced, from either a career or a technical perspective.</p>\n                                    <h2><strong>What are some common or recurring problems you see in the younger people you mentor? Do you have recommendations on how to address them? </strong></h2>\n                                    <p>Yeah, even during the CCE meeting, we shared about this. There are lots of mistakes that more experienced career professionals have made before, and we would like to see the younger folks not making them. For example, I used to be very shy in the beginning, and I used to not like to make any comments at all, but I gradually felt that it's not healthy for me or for the team because people would not be able to know what you're thinking or how to plan for things. </p>\n                                    <p>Let’s say a project is delayed because of some technical challenges, but I don't want to speak out, I don't want to raise a flag and say “Oh, I'm having some issues, I need help.” Some people may just like to not say anything, but they will just try to figure things out themselves and try to be a stronger person, because no one wants to show their weakness. That's something that I would recommend to younger people, that it's okay to work as a team. Working by yourself will carry you somewhere, but it will not carry you all the way. Eventually, you will have to work with a team, eventually you will have to work with cross-functional teams. So the earlier that you can openly network with other people, even people from other teams or companies, the better.</p>\n                                    <p>The other aspect is probably from the interview perspective. We do see that interviews are a very challenging topic for a lot of new grads, and that's why we had those CCE internship workshops. They don't know where to start to prepare or don't know how to prepare. As you spend more time in your career, you change from being an interviewee to an interviewer. You see different angles, and then we can share what the company or interviewer wants to see from an interviewee, whether it's communication skills, how confident you are, or if you're generally interested in the company or the positions. So I think focusing on these aspects will definitely help fresh grads or people who are starting to look for jobs. </p>\n                                    <h2><strong>Do you have any thoughts or suggestions on finding a suitable mentor? </strong></h2>\n                                    <p>It's very interesting; I myself have not had a mentor. I do try to follow whoever is assigned as a leader for the project or even assigned as a leader in the church. But like I told you before, I have been trying to figure things out by myself. The good thing is that it helps me to strengthen my skills in Google searching; I become more efficient in looking for information. But it also isolates me to a project that I can only do by myself, and there are some projects that need a team to accomplish, ones I wouldn't have the time, resources, or manpower to do on my own. </p>\n                                    <p>I also try to learn from people that I admire, whether it's at work or at church. One thing we talk about at church is discipleship. It's important for a person to be a disciple as well as a teacher at the same time, because once you become a teacher, you know how much you don't know. Being a mentor also helps me understand which area I need to build up more and strengthen. If I'm hungry, I won’t be able to feed other people in need, but if I can grow my crops and grow more fruit, then I have a lot more resources and I can provide for more people.</p>\n                                    <p>Finding a good mentor depends on the individual. I would suggest finding someone that you feel mutually connected to and also someone that you look up to, because you know that you'll be able to build a good relationship with that person. But more importantly, once you are a mentee, I think it's also good that you become a mentor for someone else at the same time. That way you will know what you should seek from your mentor, you’ll know how much you have learned and gained, and you can provide for the mentee that's following you. </p>\n                                    <p>So back to that 3 ducks example. If you’re the middle duck, you have someone to follow and you’re leading someone from behind as well. If you keep receiving and learning, but you don't actually teach or pass it on to other people, you never know if you have that knowledge or that skill. But once you actually try to teach or train another person, you understand whether you know that subject matter thoroughly or not. Once you get into the mentor position, once you start to teach or pass on knowledge, you start to know what area, skill, or personal relationship you still need to equip more. That's when you know that you also want to have a mentor to help you out with those areas.</p>\n                                    <h2><strong>What are your views on getting certifications? How important was your Cisco certification to your job, and how beneficial was it to your learning?</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>Studying for certification gives you a goal, whether it's some skills you want to have, or certain technology you want to learn. It could be a Cisco certificate, some courses you take on Coursera, or maybe some other application, like Amazon AWS. It’s more practical in a way, since you can put it on your resume. That would definitely help in getting the first job or a very skill-specific job, but as you become more experienced in the industry, those certifications become less relevant. As you become more experienced in the industry, a lot more will be about how you networked with your previous colleagues and your reputation from a previous project or company. That is actually more valuable than certification or skills themselves. </p>\n                                    <p>For example, for the start-up job that I landed in, I didn't actually look for it on a job site; I was contacted by another software developer manager. I worked in the test team and he worked on the software development as the director. So he saw that I was doing automation of a scaled testbed involving lots of servers. I used a clever way to automate that process so that it saves time configuring the different servers to setup or test with that amount of test gear. He was really impressed with that project, so when he went to a startup company, I guess they were trying to look for software test positions, and he thought about me. He reached out to me on LinkedIn and also contacted me on the phone. That's how I landed my first start-up job, and eventually it was acquired by Intel. </p>\n                                    <p>Certification helps for concrete skills, and also helps for landing may be your first or second job, but at the end of the day, as you grow more experienced and as you work in different projects and different companies, the networking aspect becomes more important. It's all about who the people you know are and what your relationships with different teams and different colleagues are. </p>\n                                    <h2><strong>Since you've worked at a startup and also later at Cisco, what do you think is the difference between startup culture and corporate culture? Which one would you recommend? </strong></h2>\n                                    <p>It depends on the personality. So I started at Cisco, working in a large corporate company, and then I went to Barefoot Networks, a startup company, and then they got acquired by Intel, which is also a large corporate company. When you’re working in a large corporation, a lot of processes are already defined; there's a typical way of doing things, and there are already standard tools for doing your job. I guess it’s like working in a factory; you get assigned a station, then you learn how to do the job function, and how to control the equipment and the device. You're at a position and then just let things run; I feel that's how corporate works. If you try to introduce a new change or new processes, it typically takes a much longer time than at a start-up company. It will also take a lot more effort to change the company culture. I think it's geared towards people who want a more stable job or who don't like a lot of changes in their working method. They don't want to change anything; they just want to work.</p>\n                                    <p>But for working in a startup company, you have to be someone open to do anything as needed. A lot of time in start-up companies, the process is not defined, there's no well-documentation. You often need to evaluate new tools or open source tools. You may spend a lot of time researching tools, equipment or products, looking for what would work well with our own product. So working in a startup is very dynamic, and exciting, because you are constantly learning new things. Being in a startup company also means that you work in a much smaller team, a smaller company, so you actually get to know a lot more people than in the corporate world. Maybe you could even talk to the CEO and have lunch with them. So I see that for a startup company, it's much better for people who are more ambitious and open to a dynamic work environment, and also for people who like to have daily challenges, who are not afraid of evaluating different things. So even if you were like a software test engineer, you may get assigned to do some other things that are not in your job profile. I actually learned more about the software development process in a start-up company than in a corporate company, because sometimes I have to also work from that perspective before I can type the code. </p>\n                                    <p>But startup companies also may not be as stable, and the benefit may not be as good. In Silicon Valley, it's a common saying that only 1 out of 10 startups will work out, so you only have a one in ten chance of succeeding.</p>\n                                    <p>Even so, I definitely recommend to younger people that if they want to try out a startup company, may as well try it as early as possible, because you have a lot less of a burden, whether it's a financial burden or family and kids burden. You get to grow a lot faster than in the corporate world, because you keep on absorbing new skills and you're much closer with your colleagues. You may even get to know the CEO, why they had the vision to create that company or develop that type of product or technology. So it's definitely very beneficial for younger people. But if you like a more stable job, the corporate world is probably a better fit.</p>\n                                    <p>We all have to think about our own careers and what type of jobs we want to do. That's why there are so many different types of jobs and different company cultures, and there has to be one that fits your requirements. Different people have different goals, so minus the monetary needs, you want to pick a career that you love, and one you’ll be able to grow and excel in.</p>\n                                    <br></br>\n                                    <h1 className=\"text-center\">&middot; &middot; &middot;</h1>\n                                    <h2 className=\"text-center\"><strong>Tips for Finding Resources and Mentors</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>This generation now is very blessed because there's a wealth of information and resources online, whether it's on Google, YouTube, or open forums. That's a blessing, but that could also be a curse because we often have an information overload. So how do we figure out what's the right way to approach networking with people in the industry? I would recommend joining the CCE platform. This is one of the platforms that was created to network with career veterans to young professionals, newly grads, and even high schoolers. I do see that it's a very strong platform to create a network. You're not just trying to get something, but you're actually providing something, so it's a give and receive culture.</p>\n                                    <p>Otherwise, it will be really hard. You can search for some information online, but the hit results are sometimes too overwhelming. You may get like 1000 results, and you don't know which one to go for, and each reading may even take around an hour. So it's very important to have a mentor to give general guidance on where to look for the information or to give suggestions on how to build a personal network, as well as a career network. </p>\n                                    <br></br>\n                                    <h2 className=\"text-center\"><strong>Tips for STEM students</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>For STEM students, there's 2-dimensional growth. You could grow wide, basically learning all the different subject matters, but you also want to learn from a system perspective. You could learn about different areas like physics, chemistry, electronics, where you learn from the width perspective. Or you can learn from the depth perspective, where your subject matter is of a very focused area, like how electrons work in a circuit or something like that. There's a need for generalists as well as experts. But if you're a generalist, I would suggest picking one or two subject matters to grow a little bit deeper on. Otherwise, you’ll only know the big picture, but there are specific details you may be missing out on. If you are an expert on something, I would suggest broadening up the horizon and learning from a bigger picture on how different technologies or different things work together. </p>\n                                    <div className=\"text-center\">\n                                        <img className=\"chronicle-pics\" src={softskills} alt=\"soft skills\" />\n                                    </div>\n                                    <p>I'm a generalist myself, so I often feel that I'm not an expert enough in any of the things that I know; that's why this is also a challenge for me. I started to train myself to be more equipped in one or two programming languages, or even known protocols in the networking field. So at least I'm like an expert in that field, but I also know a whole bunch of different things, even from art or business or accounting. So it's actually good to be a generalist, but you also need to dig deep in one or two areas. </p>\n                                    <p>So to summarize, you can be either a generalist or a specialist. If you are going for the generalist path, I would suggest you pick up one or two skills to grow deeper on. If you are a specialist, I would suggest to not only focus on that specialty you have, but also to try to expand, because it will benefit you. Once you see the bigger picture, then you can go even deeper. And then for generalists, if you can look at a lot of things, but you understand something in more detail, then you know much better how everything works together.</p>\n                                    <p>For example, let's say you're designing a chip, an ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit). You may know how it works, but then in order to design that chip, you have to go all the way down to how different registers or gates work before we can come up with the big problem. But if you don't know the big product, then how do you design the small parts? So two types of people are needed; one is more on the system level, and the other one is more on the component level. But it would be good if the system-level people would get to learn more about the components, while the component designer would be able to learn more about how the general system works. Then they could be a benefit by designing the system and components to work better together. </p>\n                                    <p>The other point is, once you look from the perspective of other teams, you could solve a lot of communication problems or even conflicts. Sometimes if you don't see it from the other person's perspective, sometimes the team doesn't function well together. So I do wish that each team or each person would be able to look at it from both big and small perspectives, and also from different angles. That way when you're designing a product, teamwork will be smoother.</p>\n                                    <p>[This also brings back to my earlier point on preparing for an interview.] In the interview, of course, the technical perspective or skill would be a major chunk of it, but ultimately most teams or companies want to have someone that works well with them. You can spend some time training a person for new skills, but training a person to work better with the team is a much harder task. So I would strongly recommend not just focus on technical skills, but also try to learn a lot more about soft skills: how to work with people, how to have better communication, how to be more proactive, and how to work in a team. You can learn a lot of that in college or high school, because there are lots of team projects. That experience is definitely something that you can carry with you to your career, because no matter what company you go to, we have to work as a team. </p>\n                                    <br></br>\n                                </Col>\n                                <Col md=\"2\"></Col>\n                            </Row>\n                        </Container>\n                        <Container className=\"main-page text-center\">\n                            <Button href=\"/chronicles\" variant=\"info\">All Chronicles</Button>\n                        </Container>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <Footer />\n            </div>\n        );\n    }\n}\n\nexport default CertificationHelps;","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/outsideOfSchool.8fe982db.png\";","import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport '../App.css';\nimport AppNavbar from '../components/AppNavbar';\nimport Footer from '../components/Footer';\nimport { Container, Row, Col } from 'reactstrap';\n// import ChroniclesHeader from '../components/ChroniclesHeader';\nimport bindu from '../resources/images/mentors/Bindu.png';\nimport outside from '../resources/images/chronicles/outsideOfSchool.png';\nimport passionate from '../resources/images/chronicles/passionateAbout.png';\nimport { Button } from 'react-bootstrap';\n\nclass CommunicationIsKey extends Component {\n    render() {\n        return (\n            <div className=\"all-content\">\n                <div className=\"content-wrap\">\n                    <AppNavbar />\n                    {/* <div className=\"blue-container\">\n                        <ChroniclesHeader />\n                    </div> */}\n                    <div className=\"main-page\">\n                        <Container className=\"text-center\">\n                            <h1>Communication Is Key</h1>\n                            <h6 className=\"authors\">BY JUSTIN CHOW &middot; RAY CHANG &middot; SELINA YANG &middot; SABRINA TENG &middot; NATHAN YANG &middot; HARRY SIO</h6>\n                            <h6 className=\"date\">Septemeber 17, 2021 &middot; 7 min read</h6>\n                        </Container>\n                        <a href=\"#\" id=\"introduction\"></a>\n                        <Container className=\"text-center\">\n                            <img className=\"chronicle-pics\" src={bindu} alt=\"Bindu's headshot\" />\n                        </Container>\n                        <Container>\n                            <Row>\n                                <Col md=\"2\"></Col>\n                                <Col md=\"8\">\n                                    <br></br>\n                                    <p>Bindu Therthala is the director of software engineering working at ON Semiconductors.

She teamed up with fellow software engineers co-workers in 2016. Her day-to-day tasks include assigning people to projects and priorities. This requires her to work cross-functionally with every department: hardware, software, marketing, customer support, etc. Her main role is to serve as a leader for her team and deliver Wi-Fi products by writing firmware for their computer chips. She is also responsible for planning, monitoring, and delivering a product. So for the hardware team, she helps solve problems in regards to optimizing performance of their network security. With the insurance team, she checks in with the quality control team to make sure the product meets certain standards.

Why did you decide to pursue working at technology start-ups? What motivates you to do what you are doing now?</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>Number one driving force is passion, or simply wanting to make a difference in the world no matter how small. In her case, she said, “you must make sure that the company’s mission is well aligned with your goals in a start-up”. She found a purpose working for start-up companies. First, it gave her the opportunity to explore and contribute to the creation of many technological products/services. Over decades of exploring, she specializes with connective devices as they were the most important piece of technology for daily life. In Bindu’s words, she believes that everyone views connective devices more and more of a necessity that you cannot live without. From smartphones to navigating Google Maps to mobile transactions, the rapid evolution of software has exponentially grown the field and her role at start-up companies has become significantly more important over that time period. Second, she learned that if you are working in an environment free of work politics, there is a mentality to always question the status quo. Bindu appreciates how exploring new technology advancement has given way to more opportunities. Whether it's solving product issues or working with smarter people, what seems to motivate her is the opportunity to expand her deep knowledge in connective technology every day at work.</p>\n                                    <h2><strong>How did you end up doing what you do now and what happened in the process?</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>Bindu was born in India and she learned quickly that there was an emphasis in engineering and medicine. She decided to pursue engineering for multiple reasons: interest, family influence (dad and sister were both engineers), and a chance encounter. Bindu had always excelled in math and had a knack for solving problems, but in 8th grade, she first encountered a computer at school. In primary school, she knew of the existence of programming languages and electronics, but had little exposure to the field. However, since that fateful encounter, it felt as if she had found her career and has never looked back. Her journey started as a major in electrical engineering at Bangalore University but transferred into computer engineering. Since then, she has continued to be enthralled by technology and followed in the footsteps of her family to become an engineer.</p>\n                                    <a href=\"#\" id=\"collegetips\"></a>\n                                    <p>When Bindu was in her final undergraduate year, the dot-com era had just started and there was this internet explosion at the time. It was the perfect time to be hired for her first full-time job as a software engineer at Global R&D. She was quickly introduced to everything from new software to expanding her knowledge of coding. Bindu shared with me how important it is to find work experience outside of school as she had been thrown into the fire and was challenged early on at that position. She was lucky to have close mentors and experienced colleagues who recognized her hard work ethic and willingness to learn. They helped propel her career far quicker than she could have achieved herself and now serves as a director like her mentors before her. Lesson here is to always go the extra mile, as others will recognize your hard work and it will exponentially grow your skills.</p>\n                                    <div className=\"text-center\">\n                                        <img className=\"chronicle-pics\" src={outside} alt=\"outside of school\" />\n                                    </div>\n                                    <br></br>\n                                    <p>Earlier in her career, Bindu was convinced by a male colleague to start a software company specialized in connective technology as she was young and had no outside commitment other than work. This allowed her to commit her entire time to rising up the ranks and helped each of her first few start-ups go public. During this period of transition, she learned that you should never feel like you need to reach a destination, but instead be open to learning or in the case of software engineers building skill over years of hard work.</p>\n                                    <br></br>\n                                    <h2><strong>In your view, what are some characteristics you appreciate working at a startup?</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>First, an idea that challenges the status quo. There is always a risk involved because there is no tangible result. However, Bindu believes that risk is something that has always attracted her to a company. Second, since a startup company requires a team of highly qualified individuals, they should not feel afraid to voice your opinion. It’s a significantly different environment from working in a Big Tech company with 3000 employees in one department because your voice and ideas are recognized. Third, you are responsible for many different roles within a startup. On one day you may be responsible for engineering; on the second day may be quality insurance; on the third day you may be troubleshooting for a client using your product. Fourth, the bureaucracy is very limited, so you do not have to be assigned to a ten-man team or get approval from five other departments. It lessens the hoops you must jump through and Bindu very much appreciates that. Finally, she appreciates the culture as start-ups offer a very casual and inviting work environment. These are all critical components that help her decide whether she would like to work at a particular start-up.</p>\n                                    <p>Start-ups present many challenges in the work catalog, but the majority of employees who end up working for them embrace those challenges. Key characteristics that make up an employee at a start-up include the ability to be a self-starter. This means being able to jump-start a project or initiate work without anyone else having to inform you. Knowing your role is key in this situation as your knowledge from past work experience will be tested, but self-starters tend to flourish in these scenarios. Second, start-up employees tend to enjoy the freedom and ability to make their own decisions. Bindu goes on to explain how working in a large company means many tasks are assigned, and they do not offer the flexibility but rather maintain control to achieve overall success. A start-up company invites those who appreciate the freedom of working on their own tasks. Finally, an informal trait I noticed when talking with Bindu is that start-ups often have leaders who do not conform but are rather, in her own words, “rebels with a cause”. It's clear how a start-up’s work environment is better suited for her and others who share these traits.</p>\n                                    <a href=\"#\" id=\"hstips\"></a>\n                                    <h2><strong>Software Engineering seems like a very popular career, and those who are working for larger software focused companies are motivated by the larger pay. What do you have to say against this sort of notion, and maybe describe how this obstacle may affect a start-ups success?</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>If you were to join a start-up, then there will be many opportunities placed at your doorstep. However, it’s important to be realistic and realize that the end goal is to be acquired or IPO-ed by an investor. Yet, Bindu does not recommend us to take a job simply because you are guaranteed higher pay. Of course, financial stability is important, but she also said that a full-time job takes about one-third of your day. One-third of your life is spent at the office means you better enjoy your work or you will burn out sooner rather than later. Thus, Bindu emphasized that we should pick what we are passionate about, and then your commitment will determine how successful you will become.</p>\n                                    <h2><strong>Starting a software company can seem daunting to many, and typical roadblocks include struggles with confidence and a fear of failure. Do you have any suggestions to address these obstacles?</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>Bindu reassured me that many of the companies have their struggles. Especially for start-ups, financial crunch can be the difference between life and death. For start-ups, there is often no machinery and financial stability is not guaranteed, so there is a great deal of risk going off to start a software start-up company. However, Bindu shared how she views each challenge as an opportunity working for a start-up. She took the time to share how one of her early start-ups in software engineering had all the finances covered, but the 9/11 attack resulted in supporters pulling all their finances from the company. Yet, Bindu knew that what they were building was way ahead of its time, and she moved to California only to find the same prototype they built at a showcase. They were able to get a deal with a party that was interested and saved the start-up from collapse. Bindu continues to share how difficult times finding finances will demoralize even senior employees as it lowers the chances for start-ups to be publicized. However, each time she encountered that hurdle she worked towards an IPO and got acquired for millions of dollars. Again, each challenge can be seen as an opportunity to grow.</p>\n                                    <h1 className=\"text-center\">&middot; &middot; &middot;</h1>\n                                    <div className=\"text-center\">\n                                        <img className=\"chronicle-pics\" src={passionate} alt=\"passionate about\" />\n                                    </div>\n                                    <br></br>\n                                    <h2 className=\"text-center\"><strong>Tips for International Students</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>Bindu was most challenged by the language barrier. Her experience in the US was filled with miscommunications and a thick accent, as growing up in India meant she did not use English on a consistent basis. However, she noticed that places in the US are “melting pots” of cultures and many were accepting of non-native speakers. Something that remained consistent was that hard work was most valued, as this is stressed to the extreme in Asian cultures. Bindu learned quickly that communication was key: articulating details, using analogies, etc. She continues to say that in business culture, education is necessary to learn the technical points, but soft skills are vital to your success. In international countries, many of their schools do not teach these soft skills, which makes learning these skills on the fly very difficult. On the other hand, the US schools seem to teach students how to handle an argument, lead a debate, and master other soft skills before reaching higher education. Nevertheless, Bindu appreciates the freedom of being self-sufficient and enjoys the rights that come with being a green card user, despite the financial struggle she may have had early on.</p>\n                                </Col>\n                                <Col md=\"2\"></Col>\n                            </Row>\n                        </Container>\n                        <Container className=\"main-page text-center\">\n                            <Button href=\"/chronicles\" variant=\"info\">All Chronicles</Button>\n                        </Container>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <Footer />\n            </div>\n        );\n    }\n}\n\nexport default CommunicationIsKey;","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/whyapp.73cee1d9.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/PageTitleImage.2a1bbcba.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/WhoWeAre.e2c5f5ab.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/WhyCCE.b61ece95.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/Footer.f40e05cd.png\";","import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport '../App.css';\nimport AppNavbar from './AppNavbar';\nimport Footer from './Footer';\nimport { Button } from 'reactstrap';\n\nimport whyapply from '../resources/images/interview/whyapp.png';\n// import timeline from '../resources/images/application/TimeLine2022.png';\nimport pagetitle from '../resources/images/interview/PageTitleImage.png';\nimport whoweare from '../resources/images/interview/WhoWeAre.png';\nimport whyCCE from '../resources/images/interview/WhyCCE.png';\nimport foot from '../resources/images/interview/Footer.png';\n\nclass Interview extends Component {\n    render() {\n        return (\n            <div className=\"all-content\">\n                <div className=\"content-wrap\">\n                    <AppNavbar />\n                    <img width=\"100%\" src={pagetitle} alt=\"page title\" />\n                    <div class=\"why-apply-section\">\n                        <Button className=\"btn-orange apply-button-1\" size=\"lg\" color=\"warning\" href=\"https://bit.ly/ifycceinterview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Apply Now</Button>\n                        <img width=\"100%\" src={whyapply} alt=\"why apply\" />\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"light-grey-section\" className=\"text-center\">\n                        <Button className=\"btn-orange apply-button-3\" size=\"lg\" color=\"warning\" href=\"https://bit.ly/ifycceinterview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Apply Now</Button>\n                    </div>\n                    <img width=\"100%\" src={whoweare} alt=\"who we are\" />\n                    <img width=\"100%\" src={whyCCE} alt=\"why CCE\" />\n                    {/* <img width=\"100%\" src={timeline} alt=\"timeline\" /> */}\n                    <div className=\"foot-section text-center\">\n                        <img width=\"100%\" src={foot} alt=\"foot\" />\n                        <Button size=\"lg\" color=\"warning\" className=\"btn-orange apply-button-2\" href=\"https://bit.ly/ifycceinterview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Apply Now</Button>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <Footer />\n            </div>\n        );\n    }\n}\n\nexport default Interview;","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/mehdiKargar.ad8a6ee1.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/question.8a8ef5f9.png\";","import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport '../App.css';\nimport AppNavbar from '../components/AppNavbar';\nimport Footer from '../components/Footer';\nimport { Container, Row, Col } from 'reactstrap';\n// import ChroniclesHeader from '../components/ChroniclesHeader';\nimport mehdi from '../resources/images/chronicles/mehdiKargar.png';\nimport reflection from '../resources/images/chronicles/selfReflection.png';\nimport question from '../resources/images/chronicles/question.png';\nimport { Button } from 'react-bootstrap';\n\nclass BecomeStrongestPerson extends Component {\n    render() {\n        return (\n            <div className=\"all-content\">\n                <div className=\"content-wrap\">\n                    <AppNavbar />\n                    {/* <div className=\"blue-container\">\n                        <ChroniclesHeader />\n                    </div> */}\n                    <div className=\"main-page\">\n                        <Container className=\"text-center\">\n                            <h1>Become the Strongest Person</h1>\n                            <h6 className=\"authors\">BY YUCONG YANG &middot;

Dr. Kargar has a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering from Virginia Tech., where he was working on advanced coating and biomaterials. In his company, he aims to provide affordable metallic coating to protect the surfaces against wear and corrosion while reducing the usage of dangerous chemicals. Dr. Kargar encourages young people to live a life, rather than just following the track and trend that everybody else does.</p>\n                                    <h1 className=\"text-center\">&middot; &middot; &middot;</h1>\n                                    <h2><strong>How would you describe what you're doing now professionally?</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>My current job is the co-founder of a seven-year-old material science startup called Maxterial. The majority of my job is dealing with investors, senior management, shareholders as well as customers. Also, I must put the vision for the company on where it's going to go, and how those directions are going to enable something good for humans while enabling a good return on investment for shareholders.</p>\n                                    <h2><strong>What is the driving force behind your work?</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>Regarding my driving force throughout these years, I had a couple of ambitious goals. On the environmental side, we're eliminating a very toxic chemical called hexavalent chromium or chromium 6, which is widely used in the coating industry. These chemicals cause cancer. We can save the life of manufacturing workers by eliminating the use of those chemicals.</p>\n                                    <p>On the industrial side, major problems like corrosion and wear occur. Many assets are corroded every year, and that is a 2.5 trillion-dollar problem. We also want to reduce the carbon footprint associated with wear and friction by developing proper wear resistance technologies. It is estimated that 23% of the world’s energy and consequently carbon generated are used to overcome these issues today. </p>\n                                    <p>Also, we have an ambitious vision for the financial side. As I said, we always try to combine to do good and return good investment because I got people's money. We are planning to be a billion-dollar company within a reasonable timeline.</p>\n                                    <h2><strong>What is your background and how is it connected to your professional work?</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>The title of my degree was always mechanical engineering. I had a bachelor's, two master‘s, and one Ph.D., all in mechanical engineering. But, I think I am much more of a chemical engineer. My first master’s degree was related to aerospace engineering, while my second master’s was mainly biomedical and biomaterials. I was making anti-bacterial and specialty coatings. My Ph.D. was mainly chemical – even my Ph.D. advisor was not an engineer but a chemist. My other advisor was a microbiologist and an environmental engineer. On the personal side, I think what changed my attitude toward business life and everything else was my work experience for small companies from 2005 to 2009 and before I start my Ph.D. in 2009. Those companies shared an entrepreneurial environment. I had projects in 10 or 11 companies, and I was exposed to all sorts of different industries – the edible oil industry, sugar industry, power industry, you name it. Now when I started a company in 2015, I had to put on a whole different hat. I was less engaged in science and engineering but more in the sales and financial aspects of the business.</p>\n                                    <h2><strong>In your eyes, what are the necessary qualities for someone to become a successful entrepreneur?</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>To me, it is mainly a matter of wanting to leave a good and big impact and have a vision. In the past 7 years, I just paid myself the plain salary. If I were looking for short-term gains, I could get a job at a large company and I would make 4-6 times what I made as salary during these years. The thing that matters is that you need to be able to think of it as a journey toward leaving a large impact. You have a vision that you really want to make a difference in the world. When it goes into operation, you need to be able to build a team. If you know how to deal with people, then you will know how to hire the right people who have the skills, and they will work with you.</p>\n                                    <h1 className=\"text-center\">&middot; &middot; &middot;</h1>\n                                    <h2><strong>What are the types of people that you recruit into your team?</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>At the early stage of the company, I am mainly hiring senior people. The company has built this technology, and now I really need a senior person who has a lot of experience in sales. So, I try to recruit strong senior people and I will let them hire the rest of the people.</p>\n                                    <p>But there are many senior people just like other experienced people. Among all these senior people, some of them have special drives. Some people really get to the point where they really want to do something big or different. Maybe they don't know how to start a company themselves. Maybe they don't want to take too much risk, but they still want to do something more than a day-to-day job. The first vice president we hired is about to retire, but when I met him, he said, “Look, I always wanted to start my own company. I never could take a risk like that.” I said, “you know, you're a very capable person. Why don't you join us?” And he came in, and that person alone is doing the work that a group of typical employees cannot.</p>\n                                    <h2><strong>What are your thoughts on being an effective leader and keeping the team motivated for the long run?</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>That's one thing I learned over the years: a leader should be the example. If there is hard work that must be done, he is the one who does it. If working over the weekend is sometimes needed, the leader is the one who does it first. He does not just order others to do that.</p>\n                                    <p>I try not to ask people to follow a rule that I don't. In leadership, I have to set rules and standards, which should be clear to everybody. Communication is also very important. People want to make sure they are heard, not just being ordered to do this and that. When you are listening to them it shows that they are important. And if they are important, they will be more willing to look up to your leadership. Another important thing I found is that the startup CEO should spread a vision that a teammate has to understand. What is the main goal of our company? Why is this goal important? </p>\n                                    <p>Empowering is also very important. Before empowering, you should make sure nobody ever puts anyone down. Years ago, I did not understand the impact of these principles. I used to get frustrated often. I think if a leader is powerful inside, that person naturally empowers other people. But if the person naturally is insecure or weak, then they may put other people down. So, empowerment comes from people who are self-made, powerful, and more internally cohesive. Leaders also become more powerful when they empower other people. That's how I experienced it because I made that mistake when I was younger and less experienced.</p>\n                                    <p>Recruiting also plays a role because if you recruit the wrong people in the team, then all the things will go wrong. Even when you hire the wrong person, the way you deal with them is important.</p>\n                                    <a href=\"#\" id=\"hstips\"></a>\n                                    <h2><strong>Do you have any suggestions for addressing common roadblocks like lack of confidence and fear of failure?</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>Well, one straightforward suggestion is to find a good mentor – somebody who can be honest with you, who can tell you the truth, and whom you trust. If no one tells you, you may never see it or you may learn it the hard way if you ever learn.</p>\n                                    <p>The second thing goes back again to the value system of people. If the value system is only driven by people saying good stuff about you, or your vision is just to be a billionaire, to be famous, and things like that, then you will always need external sources to make you feel valuable. But if your value systems go a little differently, in my opinion, you see things differently.</p>\n                                    <div className=\"text-center\">\n                                        <img className=\"chronicle-pics\" src={reflection} alt=\"self reflection\" />\n                                    </div>\n                                    <br></br>\n                                    <p>Another thing that I also want to tell you, is to have people around yourself that appreciate your growth. There are many things we don't know. If you are dealing with people who constantly compare you with someone much better than you, a lot of time that can negatively impact your confidence and gets you into a different mode of operation. But if you also have people that appreciate your growth – for example, last year you had no idea how to raise money, but now you raised a million – that is another very important part. Be appreciative of our growth. I always tell people that in my opinion, happiness is not a matter of having. Happiness is a matter of gaining. If you get to the highest place, I don't know if you're going to feel any happiness. But when you're moving up at a proper speed, you feel a sense of happiness. I was at 900 feet yesterday but now I am at 1000 feet and that is where I expect to be, and I believe that's the kind of mindset that we have to build inside for our souls. You need a mentor to help you set your goals and metrics and celebrate meeting the goals as you meet them.</p>\n                                    <p>You don’t want to become an egoistic person, but you also don’t want to become a weak person and never appreciate your own value. So the key to being at the balance point is always having self-reflections, having somebody who gives you feedback, and somebody who believes in you. More importantly, have realistic but ambitious goals. Also, remember to celebrate small achievements. If you meet the milestone, even by a little bit, then go buy yourself a coffee or a gift or whatever. One thing that was missing in me is that I was constantly chasing the milestones. When I hit a milestone, I will immediately start looking at my next milestone. Don’t do this. Buy yourself an ice cream or buy for your teammates something appreciated. I think it's important to value our groups and be ambitious at the same time. Don't just go for a small thing but take steps towards your big goals and celebrate your success.</p>\n                                    <h1 className=\"text-center\">&middot; &middot; &middot;</h1>\n                                    <h2 className=\"text-center\"><strong>Tips for Finding a Mentor</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>I think asking for help is the first step. If you talk to me and if I don’t know that you want to hear my thoughts, it is highly unlikely for me to offer that to you. If somebody is admitting that I need help and I need to grow, people will try to help you – what do you mean by a mentor? What do you need? That's the beginning of it. During this thought process, you will start wondering and asking yourself what you really need.</p>\n                                    <p>Secondly, use your network very well. Somebody says network is net worth, so use your network to connect yourself to people. Maybe I need somebody who can speak Chinese. Sometimes people will just know a potential candidate, so I always try to use my network. So, when I started my company, one of the alumni of my university invested in my company and I told him that I need a good business mentor to teach me how to develop a fundraising plan. Then he connected me to this person, made a good friend and that's how we found him.</p>\n                                    <p>My third point, again, goes to sincerity, honesty, and thinking of what you really want to do. A good mentor will always want to help somebody figure out things or go toward the goal. The better you know what you want, the more relevant mentor you will find, and they can help you better.</p>\n                                    <p>When I was a student, I really needed somebody to teach me something about bacteria. I went to LinkedIn and searched that. I found somebody in New York with relevant expertise. I emailed him. I told him what I wanted to do and how I found him, and that person answered my question without knowing who I am! So, ask for it.</p>\n                                    <a href=\"#\" id=\"collegetips\"></a>\n                                    <h1 className=\"text-center\">&middot; &middot; &middot;</h1>\n                                    <h2 className=\"text-center\"><strong>Tips for College Students in Mechanical or Chemical Engineering</strong></h2>\n                                    <p>Well, you know it depends on your goals. To develop your leadership skills, I think to try to be active in the college program. I suggest contributing to extracurricular activities, like being a member of some student groups. Try to take some leadership position learn to deal with people. For example, in your position, you might have to get some money from someone to buy pizza for the rest of the people, and these are the things that make you think of many aspects that you have never thought of. Set yourself into a place that forces you to ask questions – can I do it? Why can’t I do it?</p>\n                                    <div className=\"text-center\">\n                                        <img className=\"chronicle-pics\" src={question} alt=\"question\" />\n                                    </div>\n                                    <br></br>\n                                    <p>Number two, if they want to be professional engineers, go for an internship and don't stick to school only. When you go into an internship, the first thing you do is to sign an IP assignment. “What is an IP assignment? I've never seen any document like that.” Just getting into that environment immediately will already make you learn so much. If there are professional development courses in the school, take them. Even basic stuff, like how to write a professional lab notebook can impact the person who wants to hire you. If you want to start a company, then expose yourself to these environments. Many of the schools nowadays have an entrepreneurship competition. At least go there, sit there, and see what these people are doing. Listen to their pitch. I think these are the things people in school should do, and you should consider that as important, maybe even more important than whether they pass a course.</p>\n                                </Col>\n                                <Col md=\"2\"></Col>\n                            </Row>\n                        </Container>\n                        <Container className=\"main-page text-center\">\n                            <Button href=\"/chronicles\" variant=\"info\">All Chronicles</Button>\n                        </Container>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <Footer />\n            </div>\n        );\n    }\n}\n\nexport default BecomeStrongestPerson;","import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport './App.css';\nimport Home from './components/Home';\nimport Webinar from './components/Webinar';\nimport { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';\n// import CustomerList from './components/CustomerList';\n// import CustomerEdit from './components/CustomerEdit';\nimport Chronicles from './components/Chronicles';\nimport PastWebinar from './components/PastWebinar';\nimport Team from './components/Team';\nimport StemNotNerds from './chronicles/StemNotNerds';\nimport ConstExposure from './chronicles/ConstExposure';\nimport GoodTech from './chronicles/GoodTech';\nimport ExploreRealWorld from './chronicles/ExploreRealWorld';\nimport InternshipsAreOpportunities from './chronicles/InternshipsAreOpportunities';\nimport PsychIsCalling from './chronicles/PsychIsCalling';\nimport YouCanDoThis from './chronicles/YouCanDoThis';\nimport DoSomethingYouLike from './chronicles/DoSomethingYouLike';\nimport TheBiggestHappiness from './chronicles/TheBiggestHappiness';\nimport Application from './components/Application';\nimport CertificationHelps from './chronicles/CertificationHelps';\nimport CommunicationIsKey from './chronicles/CommunicationIsKey';\nimport Interview from './components/Interview';\nimport BecomeStrongestPerson from './chronicles/BecomeStrongestPerson';\n\nclass App extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <Router>\n        <Switch>\n          <Route path='/' exact={true} component={Home} />\n          <Route path='/webinar' exact={true} component={Webinar} />\n          <Route path='/pastwebinar' exact={true} component={PastWebinar} />\n          <Route path='/team' exact={true} component={Team} />\n          <Route path='/chronicles' exact={true} component={Chronicles} />\n          <Route path='/application' exact={true} component={Application} />\n          <Route path='/stemnotnerds' exact={true} component={StemNotNerds} />\n          <Route path='/constexposure' exact={true} component={ConstExposure} />\n          <Route path='/goodtech' exact={true} component={GoodTech} />\n          <Route path='/explorerealworld' exact={true} component={ExploreRealWorld} />\n          <Route path='/internshipsareopportunities' exact={true} component={InternshipsAreOpportunities} />\n          <Route path='/psychiscalling' exact={true} component={PsychIsCalling} />\n          <Route path='/youcandothis' exact={true} component={YouCanDoThis} />\n          <Route path='/dosomethingyoulike' exact={true} component={DoSomethingYouLike} />\n          <Route path='/thebiggesthappiness' exact={true} component={TheBiggestHappiness} />\n          <Route path='/certificationhelps' exact={true} component={CertificationHelps} />\n          <Route path='/communicationiskey' exact={true} component={CommunicationIsKey} />\n          <Route path='/becomestrongestperson' exact={true} component={BecomeStrongestPerson} />\n          <Route path='/interview' exact={true} component={Interview} />\n        </Switch>\n      </Router>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","const reportWebVitals = onPerfEntry => {\n  if (onPerfEntry && onPerfEntry instanceof Function) {\n    import('web-vitals').then(({ getCLS, getFID, getFCP, getLCP, getTTFB }) => {\n      getCLS(onPerfEntry);\n      getFID(onPerfEntry);\n      getFCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getLCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getTTFB(onPerfEntry);\n    });\n  }\n};\n\nexport default reportWebVitals;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport './index.css';\nimport App from './App';\nimport reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';\nimport 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css'\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <React.StrictMode>\n    <App />\n  </React.StrictMode>,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n\n// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function\n// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))\n// or send to an analytics endpoint.
