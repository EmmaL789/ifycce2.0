Normally, a solution to an engineering problem depends on how you look at the problem, so there can be several solutions depending on the situation or environment that you are dealing with.

Because I was in charge, I realized that there are not many people who are focused on wireless power technology in Taiwan, which made it very difficult to recruit people with a lot of background knowledge on wireless power. However, difficult problems can be an opportunity to explore different possibilities and ways of doing things. I needed to share my knowledge on wireless power with all my colleagues to bring everyone up to the same level so we could all think about how to work together to solve the problems we faced. You can't be fighting and figuring out a problem by yourself. Working in a team with people who have different specialties allows room to provide different opinions and perspectives on the same problem, which can actually solve the problem in a more comprehensive, faster, and creative way."}),Object(g.jsx)("h1",{className:"text-center",children:"\xb7 \xb7 \xb7"}),Object(g.jsx)("h2",{children:Object(g.jsx)("strong",{children:"When you said that there are not many people working on wireless charging, how did you recognize that as an opportunity?

Sometimes I feel like the whole market looks like a jungle, and I don't know what I will get if I walk into it. To be frank, for the first six to seven years, we barely made a profit from the technology that we developed. We were too focused on technology promotion and trying to come up with a design that fit our imagination of the clients' needs, which is definitely not a realistic approach. If you don't interact with your client enough, get to know the market well, or understand the clients\u2019 demands, the only thing that you're going to develop is a product that only fits your expectations and imaginations, but not your clients\u2019. That was a big failure for us. We had developed something that looked pretty nice, and we thought that was a perfect solution for certain applications.

If you put your head into something that people don't really know, it's just at that moment in time, they didn't know that they needed it. But if you can see the need for your product, you can see its potential. If you can see what the technology can actually bring to people, you should be confident enough to actually put your hands into that area. When Apple announced its first smartphone, people were confused about what they are going to do with this phone. It didn\u2019t even have buttons, and they had no idea how to use it.

The reason why I say this is because the wireless charging we see now in the smartphone is just a fundamental, cost-effective solution that can bring wireless power into our daily life, but it is not the perfect solution. If you ask anyone who is working on wireless power, you would probably get a very similar answer. The reason why we are adopting wireless power is because we want a fairly good charging distance and good spatial freedom, which is our ultimate expectation for wireless charging. So far, I don\u2019t believe there is anything like this on the market. The solution we see on the market nowadays is just something that companies are trying to get a profit out of, and unfortunately it has become an industry standard. They developed a product and released it even though they knew that the product is not perfect. We should dedicate time to bringing this technology into the best shape it can be. It should have features like further transferring distance, high efficiency, simultaneous one-to-multiple charging, and most importantly, spatial freedom, which means that as long as you put your receiver on the charging pad you should be able to continuously charge without any interference."}),Object(g.jsx)("h1",{className:"text-center",children:"\xb7 \xb7 \xb7"}),Object(g.jsx)("h2",{className:"text-center",children:Object(g.jsx)("strong",{children:"Tips for College Students"})}),Object(g.jsx)("p",{children:"I remember when I was in university or high school, many courses weren't mandatory.

I think my advice is don't take the shortcut, or stated in a positive way, use your time wisely on the things that you think are worth investing in. If you know that you're going to an administrative job, of course you need to know how to use Excel, spreadsheets, or something like that. But if you know that you are going to be a power-system engineer, then you need to be familiar with simulation tools. If you are going to be an electronic design engineer, you need to know how the operational amplifier works. If you know that you are going in a certain direction, then you have to reflect on the skill sets that you need to have to make your life easier in the future.

We need to set up goals for ourselves, and then we need to set a direction. For example, once you realize you want to be an electrical engineer, you need to know what you need to do to get yourself prepared to go onto that path.

You can also talk to your friends in school or actually go to a few classes on different topics to see how you like them, so you will have more of an idea of what's your interests and passions. Talk to people. Talk to your friends, seniors, or even people who are already working. How did they figure out what they wanted?

You cannot just follow people\u2019s footsteps, or try to mimic something that you don't really know that well. I say this because when I came back to Taiwan, I realized that a lot of research and development work is done by copying reference designs that are provided by other companies, so engineers tend to use other people\u2019s design, and maybe modify them into a product. That is not research and development, but rather production engineering. I think something that we need to think about is that we chose this career path because we like to understand the fundamental concepts of each idea, even if it is just an equation or a formula. When we are taking a test, we should quote an equation because we understand it, not just because we memorized it.

Instead of that, what worked for us was to make a skateboard, then a scooter, then a bike, then a car. You want to make progress as you go, instead of trying to make it perfect. We get overwhelmed when we do things that aren\u2019t impactful, so we don\u2019t make progress. We have to make mini progresses to get data; we fail and we fix.

Early on, we used the TCL language for automation, but now the industry standard has moved to Python automation. It helps a lot because it could be the same protocol, but we are testing against different hardware or different software releases.

Then from the output, you parse through different interesting values and keys, and make sure that the output is as expected. Now, why did it change to Python?

That's something that I would recommend to younger people, that it's okay to work as a team. Working by yourself will carry you somewhere, but it will not carry you all the way. Eventually, you will have to work with a team, eventually you will have to work with cross-functional teams.

We do see that interviews are a very challenging topic for a lot of new grads, and that's why we had those CCE internship workshops.

You see different angles, and then we can share what the company or interviewer wants to see from an interviewee, whether it's communication skills, how confident you are, or if you're generally interested in the company or the positions.

It's important for a person to be a disciple as well as a teacher at the same time, because once you become a teacher, you know how much you don't know. Being a mentor also helps me understand which area I need to build up more and strengthen.

I would suggest finding someone that you feel mutually connected to and also someone that you look up to, because you know that you'll be able to build a good relationship with that person.

But once you actually try to teach or train another person, you understand whether you know that subject matter thoroughly or not.

I worked in the test team and he worked on the software development as the director. So he saw that I was doing automation of a scaled testbed involving lots of servers. I used a clever way to automate that process so that it saves time configuring the different servers to setup or test with that amount of test gear. He was really impressed with that project, so when he went to a startup company, I guess they were trying to look for software test positions, and he thought about me.

So I started at Cisco, working in a large corporate company, and then I went to Barefoot Networks, a startup company, and then they got acquired by Intel, which is also a large corporate company. When you\u2019re working in a large corporation, a lot of processes are already defined; there's a typical way of doing things, and there are already standard tools for doing your job. I guess it\u2019s like working in a factory; you get assigned a station, then you learn how to do the job function, and how to control the equipment and the device. You're at a position and then just let things run; I feel that's how corporate works. If you try to introduce a new change or new processes, it typically takes a much longer time than at a start-up company. It will also take a lot more effort to change the company culture. I think it's geared towards people who want a more stable job or who don't like a lot of changes in their working method. They don't want to change anything; they just want to work."}),Object(g.jsx)("p",{children:"But for working in a startup company, you have to be someone open to do anything as needed. A lot of time in start-up companies, the process is not defined, there's no well-documentation. You often need to evaluate new tools or open source tools. You may spend a lot of time researching tools, equipment or products, looking for what would work well with our own product. So working in a startup is very dynamic, and exciting, because you are constantly learning new things. Being in a startup company also means that you work in a much smaller team, a smaller company, so you actually get to know a lot more people than in the corporate world. Maybe you could even talk to the CEO and have lunch with them. So I see that for a startup company, it's much better for people who are more ambitious and open to a dynamic work environment, and also for people who like to have daily challenges, who are not afraid of evaluating different things. So even if you were like a software test engineer, you may get assigned to do some other things that are not in your job profile.

I would recommend joining the CCE platform. This is one of the platforms that was created to network with career veterans to young professionals, newly grads, and even high schoolers.

Or you can learn from the depth perspective, where your subject matter is of a very focused area, like how electrons work in a circuit or something like that. There's a need for generalists as well as experts. But if you're a generalist, I would suggest picking one or two subject matters to grow a little bit deeper on. Otherwise, you\u2019ll only know the big picture, but there are specific details you may be missing out on.

So at least I'm like an expert in that field, but I also know a whole bunch of different things, even from art or business or accounting.

If you are going for the generalist path, I would suggest you pick up one or two skills to grow deeper on. If you are a specialist, I would suggest to not only focus on that specialty you have, but also to try to expand, because it will benefit you. Once you see the bigger picture, then you can go even deeper. And then for generalists, if you can look at a lot of things, but you understand something in more detail, then you know much better how everything works together."}),Object(g.jsx)("p",{children:"For example, let's say you're designing a chip, an ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit). You may know how it works, but then in order to design that chip, you have to go all the way down to how different registers or gates work before we can come up with the big problem. But if you don't know the big product, then how do you design the small parts? So two types of people are needed; one is more on the system level, and the other one is more on the component level. But it would be good if the system-level people would get to learn more about the components, while the component designer would be able to learn more about how the general system works. Then they could be a benefit by designing the system and components to work better together. "}),Object(g.jsx)("p",{children:"The other point is, once you look from the perspective of other teams, you could solve a lot of communication problems or even conflicts. Sometimes if you don't see it from the other person's perspective, sometimes the team doesn't function well together.

That way when you're designing a product, teamwork will be smoother."}),Object(g.jsx)("p",{children:"[This also brings back to my earlier point on preparing for an interview.] In the interview, of course, the technical perspective or skill would be a major chunk of it, but ultimately most teams or companies want to have someone that works well with them.

So I would strongly recommend not just focus on technical skills, but also try to learn a lot more about soft skills: how to work with people, how to have better communication, how to be more proactive, and how to work in a team. You can learn a lot of that in college or high school, because there are lots of team projects.

Third, you are responsible for many different roles within a startup.

On the personal side, I think what changed my attitude toward business life and everything else was my work experience for small companies from 2005 to 2009 and before I start my Ph.D. in 2009. Those companies shared an entrepreneurial environment. I had projects in 10 or 11 companies, and I was exposed to all sorts of different industries \u2013 the edible oil industry, sugar industry, power industry, you name it.

The thing that matters is that you need to be able to think of it as a journey toward leaving a large impact. You have a vision that you really want to make a difference in the world. When it goes into operation, you need to be able to build a team.

Among all these senior people, some of them have special drives. Some people really get to the point where they really want to do something big or different. Maybe they don't know how to start a company themselves. Maybe they don't want to take too much risk, but they still want to do something more than a day-to-day job. The first vice president we hired is about to retire, but when I met him, he said, \u201cLook, I always wanted to start my own company. I never could take a risk like that.\u201d I said, \u201cyou know, you're a very capable person.

If there is hard work that must be done, he is the one who does it. If working over the weekend is sometimes needed, the leader is the one who does it first. He does not just order others to do that.\nI try not to ask people to follow a rule that I don't. In leadership, I have to set rules and standards, which should be clear to everybody. Communication is also very important. People want to make sure they are heard, not just being ordered to do this and that. When you are listening to them it shows that they are important. And if they are important, they will be more willing to look up to your leadership. Another important thing I found is that the startup CEO should spread a vision that a teammate has to understand. What is the main goal of our company? Why is this goal important?\nEmpowering is also very important. Before empowering, you should make sure nobody ever puts anyone down. Years ago, I did not understand the impact of these principles. I used to get frustrated often. I think if a leader is powerful inside, that person naturally empowers other people. But if the person naturally is insecure or weak, then they may put other people down. So, empowerment comes from people who are self-made, powerful, and more internally cohesive. Leaders also become more powerful when they empower other people. That's how I experienced it because I made that mistake when I was younger and less experienced.\nRecruiting also plays a role because if you recruit the wrong people in the team, then all the things will go wrong.

If no one tells you, you may never see it or you may learn it the hard way if you ever learn.\nThe second thing goes back again to the value system of people. If the value system is only driven by people saying good stuff about you, or your vision is just to be a billionaire, to be famous, and things like that, then you will always need external sources to make you feel valuable. But if your value systems go a little differently, in my opinion, you see things differently.\nAnother thing that I also want to tell you, is to have people around yourself that appreciate your growth. There are many things we don't know. If you are dealing with people who constantly compare you with someone much better than you, a lot of time that can negatively impact your confidence and gets you into a different mode of operation. But if you also have people that appreciate your growth \u2013 for example, last year you had no idea how to raise money, but now you raised a million \u2013 that is another very important part. Be appreciative of our growth. I always tell people that in my opinion, happiness is not a matter of having. Happiness is a matter of gaining. If you get to the highest place, I don't know if you're going to feel any happiness. But when you're moving up at a proper speed, you feel a sense of happiness. I was at 900 feet yesterday but now I am at 1000 feet and that is where I expect to be, and I believe that's the kind of mindset that we have to build inside for our souls. You need a mentor to help you set your goals and metrics and celebrate meeting the goals as you meet them.\nYou don\u2019t want to become an egoistic person, but you also don\u2019t want to become a weak person and never appreciate your own value.  So the key to being at the balance point is always having self-reflections, having somebody who gives you feedback, and somebody who believes in you. More importantly, have realistic but ambitious goals. Also, remember to celebrate small achievements. If you meet the milestone, even by a little bit, then go buy yourself a coffee or a gift or whatever. One thing that was missing in me is that I was constantly chasing the milestones. When I hit a milestone, I will immediately start looking at my next milestone. Don\u2019t do this. Buy yourself an ice cream or buy for your teammates something appreciated. I think it's important to value our groups and be ambitious at the same time.

During this thought process, you will start wondering and asking yourself what you really need.\nSecondly, use your network very well. Somebody says network is net worth, so use your network to connect yourself to people. Maybe I need somebody who can speak Chinese. Sometimes people will just know a potential candidate, so I always try to use my network. So, when I started my company, one of the alumni of my university invested in my company and I told him that I need a good business mentor to teach me how to develop a fundraising plan. Then he connected me to this person, made a good friend and that's how we found him.\nMy third point, again, goes to sincerity, honesty, and thinking of what you really want to do. A good mentor will always want to help somebody figure out things or go toward the goal. The better you know what you want, the more relevant mentor you will find, and they can help you better.\nWhen I was a student, I really needed somebody to teach me something about bacteria.

If there are professional development courses in the school, take them. Even basic stuff, like how to write a professional lab notebook can impact the person who wants to hire you.

I think for young college students it may be too early for you to think ahead. But when you have a chance to start your graduate school, that would be a good time to start thinking about it. So, after you graduate from a Ph.D. or master, you have to think about whether you want to go to academia or to the industry. If you want to stay in academia and apply for a faculty position, it will be more like an independent lab setting. You will get several years of postdoc training, maybe 3 to 4 years, or even 5 years and above. Typically, you do the innovative science by the lab work, trying to publish the paper in the journal to show your strength, and applying for the faculty position. You might apply for an instructor job in the beginning or assistant professor, whether it's a non-tenure or tenure track. Usually the admission rate of an assistant professor job is less than 10%, or I would say 5% sometimes, but you don't have to be discouraged by that. I mentioned the low admission rate not to suggest you go to the industry, but instead to encourage you to really think about whether you are interested in basic science in academia. The professors who won the Nobel Prize \u2013 they are really motivated by the new discovery and the science they found in the lab, and that is the motivation which keeps them thinking about the current challenges, thinking about the new ways to solve it, designing the experiments and performing them. On the real side, once you become a professor, you also have to recruit postdocs and graduate students, mentor them to do the lab work, and write the research grants for funding. If you don't have funding, you don't have any budget money to establish a lab because you must purchase all the equipment and reagents. Usually the grant acceptance rate is pretty low, too \u2013 most of the grants have an acceptance rate of less than 10%, and for some big grant like R01 from NIH, it would be less than 5%. So most of the time professors have to submit the grant proposal but may not get accepted for several times. So the failing rate is similar to the drug discovery rate \u2013 it's just a different setting.

It is going to be very cross-functional and dynamic, and some people like this kind of teamwork because there will be more face-to-face interactions. Each team works on a different part, and they go through the communication and drive the drug discovery process altogether as a team. You don\u2019t need to worry about grants in the industry. We can order the reagents and equipment without worrying about writing a grant, but by the end of the day it is all about the cost. So many professors end up with no grant, and they have to transfer to a different job, which is one of their risks. There is also a risk in the industry \u2013 you might get laid off when there is a reorganization within big Pharmas, but usually this does not happen very frequently. Some people have a myth that you won\u2019t have to worry about losing a job like people in the industry once you get your tenure in academia. It's not the case, because even if you are an associate professor, if you run out of grants, you will have no money [to do research or pay the salary for your postdocs and graduate students]. Similarly, in industry, if you get laid off, it is not because you're not doing a good job. It's usually because the leadership team of the Pharma or biotech decide to focus more on other stuff, like vaccines and mRNA technology, and they may double down the resources, the budget, and the manpower [in these departments]. At the same time, some other departments may be deprioritized, and the people in those other departments will get impacted. But I don\u2019t think you should worry if you will get laid off, because if you have a strong skill set and strong expertise, many other companies will recruit you right away.

We have our own rationale based on the biology and our studies, while for clinical doctors, they think in terms of the reality \u2013 breast cancer patients and lung cancer patients have different standards of care treatments and different safety profiles, so we have to evaluate them together.

I got rejected from different applications for the industry \u2013 I applied for almost 200 jobs before I got into the industry because I was just a fresh Ph.D. graduate. You might think that having a Ph.D. is cool. No. In industry, the majority of R&D scientists are Ph.D., and you are just another Ph.D. who doesn't have industry experience. If some of the companies do think, based on your Ph.D. training in academia, there's a need that they think you are a good fit so that you get an offer, that is your opportunity.

In fact, my manager knew about my background and every year he asked me if I wanted to go back to management. I kept saying no until one day when he decided to leave the company, and I was asked by his manager to step into this role.

So for most of the time in the meeting, I'll just be quiet and let them do their own thing, unless they need some help or they don't have some details.

But for the most part, I allow them to speak for themselves, and also let them learn from their mistakes. I always encourage people to take risks.

So it's actually good to identify that and to be able to work with them or to help them. When their personal situation is under better control, typically their work will also improve.

That is because in my first company, the way to promote a top engineer who does well is to promote them into a manager role, so I was promoted to the manager role not necessarily because they saw me as a good manager although I did show some initiative. Actually that is a wrong concept. Being a manager doesn't necessarily mean being high in position. That is something at Nvidia that we always make very clear. There's a track for individual contributors to focus on technical work, and there's also the management track, which emphasizes on people management, but that wasn't the case in my first company. So, once you become a top engineer, naturally you just become a manager. But they still expect you to continue working on the technical aspect, and that becomes a lot of pressure.

I've also seen cases when my team members have personal situations, whether it's in their marriage or there's some illness in the family that they need to take care of. In these cases, we need to make sure these people have the time that they need to deal with their personal situation, while at the same time for me to be able to find somebody to take over the job, and for them to be able to not  worry about losing their job. Because that is the last thing you want to give to somebody who is already dealing with a situation at home.

So when you have that kind of leadership example, it makes it very difficult [to foster a culture that values everyone\u2019s life quality and a culture of stability]. Versus in Nvidia, where most of the managers that I know, from a low level manager all the way to our CEO, we can see a lot of emphasis on family and taking time off to spend time with the family. In fact, all our managers are very aware of that. As we are a global company where people are from many different time zones, we always emphasize avoiding meetings during dinner time, when you're supposed to be spending time with your family. So we try our best to avoid meeting time between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. Of course there are cases when we have no choice, like when there are too many time zones that you need to work with, or maybe you have urgent issues, and we may have to do [our meetings on an unfavorable time], but otherwise, by default, we try to avoid that time.

I did my undergraduate in electrical and computer engineering at Ohio State University, and then I did my master's in electrical engineering at Stanford, and then I did a master's diploma in strategy and innovation from Oxford University. Let's start from my undergraduate. To be honest, I came from Indonesia, so unlike today's age, where there's so much information with the Internet everywhere, I didn't have any of that. So I didn't really know what I was going to do in high school. I just knew that I loved science since I was young, but I really didn't know what to expect. I didn't even know what kind of majors were available. All I knew was I wanted to work on something that has a lot of math or maybe physics or chemistry, so any of those would do. Then I decided that I wanted to come to the US, but I didn't really know what to expect either. As I said, I didn't have a lot of information, and I always thought that after graduating, I'd go back to Indonesia. So my first thought would be like, OK, what can I do with my degree when I come back to Indonesia? In Indonesia, if I wanted to use my engineering degree, it\u2019d probably be in manufacturing. So because of that, the original major I chose when I applied for college was industrial system engineering."}),Object(g.jsx)("p",{children:"After I came to the US, obviously I got more exposed to information and started talking to people. But the reason why I changed my major to electrical engineering was actually out of my ego. It was just because one day my friend made a joke. A simple comment like, oh, industrial engineering is not really engineering. Not that I agree with him, but at that time I was offended. I was like, what do you mean? He said it's not really engineering because there's not a lot of math or a lot of science involved, so it's no wonder for you to get a 4.0 GPA. So I was offended. I mean, he was joking and wasn't being serious, but I took it very seriously. Then I was like \u201cOkay, what major do you consider to be the most difficult for engineering?\u201d So he then mentioned chemical engineering and electrical engineering. So I was like, okay, between the two, I like chemistry, so let me go to the Chemical Engineering Department, and then I asked for advice for transfer. The department said I could transfer, but I needed to take more chemistry classes. Yet I didn't want to take more classes, so I went to the electrical engineering major, and I asked the same questions. \u201cOh, yeah, you can transfer all your credit.\u201d So I switched to an electrical engineering major, and that's how I switched my majors because of my ego. I didn't really know what to do with that major afterwards. But thankfully, it turned out to be the right decision. Because at the time of my graduation, it was actually very difficult to find a job in the US if you majored in industrial engineering. Even for chemistry or other popular majors, it was also very difficult, especially for international students. Interestingly, I graduated at the end of 1999, and that was when the dot-com boom and things like that, so computer science and electrical and computer engineering were the hot majors."}),Object(g.jsx)("p",{children:"I actually also changed my field within electrical engineering because I was originally specialized in control systems \u2013 I did my internship for that and that was also my topic of my undergraduate honor thesis. But the quarter before I was about to graduate, I was like, \u201coh, my goodness, I hated this. I didn't want to do this anymore.\u201d Even though I got a lot of interview opportunities for my work in control systems, I didn't want to. I wanted to do something different, but I also didn't know what to do. So I basically just randomly interviewed with companies. And again, I made my decision out of my ego. You start to see a trend here. I was like, okay, I got my degree in engineering, and I was one of the top students, so I would only do design work. I didn't want to do verification work or any other work. Again, this is the wrong mindset now that I'm in the industry, but back then designer jobs were being thought of more highly. So there were some jobs which I just declined the interviews, and it took me five months from graduation to get my first job, and it was in CPU design. Again, I didn't know what I was going to do with it. I just wanted to be a designer anyway, so as long as someone was willing to hire me as a design engineer, I would just do it. So that's how I joined a startup company in CPU design, and I fell in love with it very quickly. I ended up spending eleven years of my life doing that. Until one day I was like, okay, what else can I do with it? When the boredom started to come in, things became just routines, and you just didn't get the time to think and learn new things, I started to ask myself again about my next step. That's when I decided that I wanted something higher level than CPU design. Because of my role as a director, I was able to see different aspects and a lot of cases, in both the technical side and the marketing side. I noticed that sometimes you could have a really wonderful CPU design, but if the system doesn't fully utilize the capability of the CPU, your product still suffers. Another reason why I wanted to move to the system level was because I felt that working on the system level got me closer to the final product, so you can actually think about how it contributes to the actual performance in terms of the value that it can add to the application and to the user.

There's a chance for do-over, and you never know. So I think it does not really matter that much when you make a mistake. What is more important is that, when you make a mistake, do you know when it's the time to move on or to pivot to something else? Also, when wonderful things happen to you, do you know if it's not your credit? Like in my case, it's not my credit. Do you learn to be thankful about that?

So one of the main reasons why I wanted to do this was because I thought I could just go to school and learn about management, and then come back.

During that time I actually did volunteer work in South Africa to learn how to utilize my business skills, and how to build a Kingdom business. That took me into a different journey where I spent a few months training with other people and then ended up with a two week journey in South Africa to work with the local businesses. So I got distracted with something else. And soon afterwards, something happened with my father in Indonesia that caused me to spend four months in Singapore and Indonesia with my family during that year as well. And when I came back, when this opportunity came, I didn't really feel at peace about going into that direction at all. So there were a lot of situations that required me to really quiet down and really try to listen to what my next move would be. And then one day during my quiet time with God, it was very clear God directed me that He wanted me not to touch this for the time being. Would you be willing to obey? So this was actually the year when I was going to be asked to become a manager. This happened a few months before that. When that message became clear to me, I was like, okay, I'm willing to wait and see what happened. Even though at that time I did not really understand, my commitment to Nvidia was not 100%, and I was still planning to pursue something else with my degree, I chose to obey and wait without knowing what's going to happen. And then I started to dedicate myself to my work and then see what's going on. A few months later, that's when I was asked to take the management role, and it became a decision point for me because I needed to be fully committed if I were going to manage the team. So again, after spending some time on it, I decided to say yes and dedicate my time to it. I committed to the team, and since that point on I've been very happy and also learned the lesson. You may be able to force the culture from the top, but unless you're working with the people, you may not know what their real needs are. So I feel very good about where I am today because I'm with the people. I'm able to influence those on my team through my position.
