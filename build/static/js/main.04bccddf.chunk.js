If you ask anyone who is working on wireless power, you would probably get a very similar answer. The reason why we are adopting wireless power is because we want a fairly good charging distance and good spatial freedom, which is our ultimate expectation for wireless charging. So far, I don\u2019t believe there is anything like this on the market. The solution we see on the market nowadays is just something that companies are trying to get a profit out of, and unfortunately it has become an industry standard.

When we are taking a test, we should quote an equation because we understand it, not just because we memorized it.

High computing power will give you much better results than what we currently have, and will open the door for new opportunities that include cloud computing, like Amazon's cloud computing. Another trend is more on the technical side; there are new models coming out to combine different data sets to train the model.

In the past, Amazon\u2019s impact could only reach a limited group of people over a long time, but now with these scalable AI robot distribution centers, it can operate at much faster speeds and can reach people globally. In the hands of AI, work is more efficient. The other thing is AI is doing cutting-edge research for health.

The other side of AI is the challenge that in the future if AI is working in all areas, people have to ask, \u201cHow can I improve myself to embrace these changes and to work together with AI techniques to make my work more efficient and essential?\u201d.

Many years ago when I was a grad student at Florida State University, I was teaching my own section of principles of microeconomics, and I met a really bright Korean American student, who was super interested in economics. After that class, she would always drop by my office hour and chat with me. Since we are both female and Asian, she felt very close to me. She was not an economics major back then but she later switched to economics. Several years later I got contacted by one of my former professors, and he said, \u201cLi, do you know what happened to that student of yours? After she switched her major to economics, she really loved it. She graduated with a 4.0 GPA, and she ended up working for Google.\u201d"}),Object(p.jsx)("p",{children:"I like to tell my students that story because sometimes I feel like, out of the thousands of students I teach, if I can really make a difference in just one student's life, that will be enough. We all need mentors along the way, someone who's a few years ahead of you, who can give you some insight that will help you navigate. Sometimes we don't know for sure if our major is the thing that we want to do. Sometimes we don't know what kind of jobs will be available to us. So I always try to work with young minds because you can do a whole lot with young minds as you're guiding them along that path."}),Object(p.jsx)("h2",{children:Object(p.jsx)("strong",{children:"That is a very encouraging story.

There, once you get your PhD, you go to developing countries and help them design an educational system that will work for minority or underprivileged students. However, life always throws you curveballs, and I didn't end up doing that thanks to a class taught by a life-changing professor to me. That professor was a Stanford graduate, a sociologist, and also a passionate economist. When I was an undergrad, I actually didn\u2019t like economics. For example, the supply demand curve. Why are you shifting this curve and not that curve? It just does not make any sense to me back then. Only after I was around 23-year-old did I start seeing the beauty of economics and find it super-fascinating, and I started to take a lot of economics classes. Unfortunately, when I was about to defend my dissertation prospect, that professor passed away because of cancer.

It is okay to fail, and it's okay to fail many times, because sometimes those experiences enrich your future. So back to my story, after I went through all that trouble and circled back to economics, guess what, I actually became one of the research stars in my cohort. It is not because I was better, but because my previous major gave me insight for new and different questions. I am interested in a lot of education policy issues that they didn\u2019t get exposed to. When I was in my undergrad, I was able to see how teachers received their training, so when I started to work as an economist, I can approach those education policy research from different perspectives. Instead of just focusing on students, I also ask questions about teachers. Are we keeping teachers in the classrooms? Can we encourage them to become a teacher? How can we attract them into teaching? What do they have to give up, such as those industry jobs, if they decide to be a teacher?

Sometimes I have to listen to God's words and ask myself what God is trying to tell me. Sometimes I do get frustrated. For example, when my professor passed away during my PhD, I asked God, \u201c why'd you kick my professor away when I was a poor grad student? I was trying to struggle through the program, and I\u2019ve made it so far. Why did you take him away?\u201d I still remember my professor's funeral. I was crying.

So we spent time training, teaching, and trying to find people that are like us."}),Object(p.jsx)("p",{children:"Another thing that happened with time was that I cut off a lot of people in my life, and created a circle around the people that helped me. It was painful in the beginning, but you have to surround yourself with the right people. I think we\u2019ve all heard that from somewhere, but I didn\u2019t listen to it. I really valued every relationship I had, but I realized there were some that slowed me down a lot. Or if you spend less time with them, you don\u2019t have to cut ties completely, and then you can visit or help them back. To give you an extreme example, I had to cut my relationship with my family, because they were really hurting me. But now I\u2019m really close with them, and we\u2019re way closer than before. All the scars are healed and everything is much better."}),Object(p.jsx)("p",{children:"Knowing how to do that, delegating and being with the right people, is very helpful and balancing.

Sometimes people say I\u2019m a workaholic, and even though work makes me happy, if I knew I was getting in over my head, I have to stop. If you know something\u2019s good for you, and you don\u2019t want to do it, most of the time you should do it. Healthy food normally isn\u2019t super tasty, but you need to eat it.

It was usually one to two, and then we kept moving to different places, because of my father\u2019s job as an international trader. So I did have an identity crisis, as well as a language problem. It was hard for me to make friends I\u2019d get used to. So when we went to the states, I asked my dad, \u201cI wanna stop moving, I wanna settle down and make friends.\u201d But since I was young, I don\u2019t think I knew what I was asking.

That\u2019s when I started working 5 jobs, like as a waiter or in a warehouse; any jobs that would pay me, since I couldn\u2019t get a legitimate job. That led me to start a business.

Like I said earlier, believing you are meant for something, and that you didn\u2019t come this far to not have an opportunity, makes your story and your faith stronger. It makes you more capable, because you overcame more than what others had to. It\u2019s a good challenge to have, and you\u2019ll be a testimony to not having any excuses. I really think the people who overcome more will be more successful in general. The more issues, the better the chances."}),Object(p.jsx)("p",{children:"I was also really bad at words, but if you can\u2019t speak, you can\u2019t be a CEO, right?

I think that\u2019s what made us rely on God more, since we couldn\u2019t rely on the benefits. We had nothing which we could have done by ourselves, so we just had to keep asking God; there were no other options. The door He opened was better than the loan, it was better than anything.

Since God has opened so many doors for me, I\u2019m more confident, and I don\u2019t care if it doesn\u2019t happen the way I want, because He always has a better door or strategy. Any opportunity or partnership you get will go peacefully, because of what I call, a bold, humble confidence. You don\u2019t need to be cocky, but you have to have extreme confidence; it is or it isn\u2019t. Faith and confidence align.

People should look for you, not you looking for where you want to go. It\u2019s a big shift, but I really believe in that. After seeing what He did for me for so many years and even to other people, I see successful people having that confidence and having that super strong relationship with God.

Taking care of employees is kind of like raising a kid, so I started raising kids, my business, when I was 25. You learn to be mature and a leader, because you have to do business. Even if you hired people of a similar age, you just naturally mature faster in your position. You can\u2019t act dumb, you can\u2019t act stupid, and you know that because people get hurt. You become more aware, more responsible, and you get to learn the necessary survival skills. You don\u2019t have to have a big business, but you learn so much in that position that you wouldn\u2019t get in any other job.

You can learn as you go on how to be better and how to make an impact. That\u2019s why I\u2019m still in eCommerce.

What I would tell my past self and every entrepreneur is to run a business like you\u2019re going to exit. When you exit, you generate a lot of wealth. And to exit, you have to run the business clean, you have to make it investable, and not make yourself the focus of the business. Buyers like businesses where they\u2019re hands-off, so they\u2019re basically buying cash flow. To be hands-off, you have to know how to systematize. So with your exit in mind, you would run a standard of a good, healthy business, and when you exit, you basically get paid a couple years up front. If it\u2019s a 4x exit, it means you fast-tracked four years.

But then the debt crisis hit, so you never know what will happen. It\u2019s like when you go to Vegas; you\u2019re not going to want to leave the table when you made the most. But I think exiting is helpful, and when you do, you can really serve the people you like.

With entrepreneurship, you\u2019re creating your own vision.
